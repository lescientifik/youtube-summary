[0:00] All
[0:14] right, thanks everyone. Sorry about the
[0:16] wait. Um, this is going to be a a bit of
[0:19] a strange session because um there is a
[0:22] workshop component to this. So, uh I
[0:24] guess everyone will be coding on their
[0:26] laps. Sorry. Um but anyways, sorry. I'm
[0:30] Peter and uh this is my colleague
[0:32] Brandon. Um so we're we're going to
[0:34] break this this session into two
[0:36] different parts. One is a um sort of a
[0:38] talk that I'm going to give about what
[0:40] context engines are are useful for and
[0:43] and how you might go about building one,
[0:44] what to think about. Um and then we'll
[0:47] we'll launch into the u the second part
[0:50] of it. So um just briefly
[0:53] um quick quick agenda. We're going to
[0:56] talk about three myths that are
[0:58] circulating uh right now about about
[1:00] context engines and then I'll go over a
[1:03] couple of less or a few lessons uh that
[1:05] we learned along the way building one of
[1:07] these things. Um and then finally we'll
[1:10] do this. So we're going to build a
[1:13] social engineering graph. Uh this is a
[1:16] component that is super useful in a
[1:19] context engine. And first just a show of
[1:22] hands. Does everyone know what I mean by
[1:23] context engine or does anyone want
[1:25] clarification on that?
[1:27] >> Okay. So uh in the world of AI agents
[1:32] uh you have agents that uh when you
[1:35] start off and you start coding they are
[1:37] basically at ground zero. They have no
[1:40] context about your code, your
[1:41] organization, nothing. Okay. So
[1:44] typically what happens is the first
[1:46] thing they do is they start to rip
[1:47] around your codebase uh based on the
[1:49] task that you give them to try to gain
[1:52] some understanding uh sort of background
[1:54] understanding before they start to do
[1:55] their task. So context engineering is is
[1:59] kind of the art of supplying uh all the
[2:02] context that you need and most
[2:04] importantly none of the context that you
[2:06] don't need in a highly optimized way so
[2:09] that when the agent starts to run it
[2:12] executes the task uh in a streamlined
[2:15] way that's in line with your
[2:17] organization's best practices and
[2:19] expectations and so on. Okay, so we'll
[2:22] get to this after.
[2:26] So, not long ago,
[2:29] as in like four years ago or less, uh
[2:32] you were the context engine. Okay? So,
[2:35] when when your agent needed something,
[2:37] um you would prompt it, you'd grab the
[2:40] the issue ticket, you'd hand it all of
[2:42] the information that it needed to start
[2:44] its task. And in many cases, even when
[2:47] it was ripping around getting background
[2:49] contexts, when it got to the end of its
[2:51] task, sometimes it it got it wrong. In
[2:53] fact, many times it did. and you'd have
[2:55] to kind of like reset it. Um, reguide it
[2:58] towards the solution that you were
[3:00] thinking of. Um, or if it completely
[3:02] missed the mark, you'd have to be like,
[3:03] "No, not the not the JavaScript dummy.
[3:06] It's the Python source code that I want
[3:08] you to look at." Um, so
[3:13] let's just remember how you built
[3:15] context in an organization. Uh, so we're
[3:18] taking AI out of the picture for it for
[3:20] for just a sec. And I just want you to
[3:22] pretend that pre- AAI uh you just joined
[3:25] an organization, let's remember how we
[3:28] built it up. So
[3:30] over time, you would accumulate this
[3:33] kind of context through experience,
[3:34] right? You would start a job, maybe
[3:36] start code splunking a little bit to
[3:38] figure out um uh how things work. You'd
[3:43] maybe latch on to a mentor. Um, and
[3:48] eventually you'd you'd experience real
[3:50] things like incidents and outages and
[3:52] things like that. Those are sort of the
[3:54] the pain things that stick with you.
[3:56] Those are the battle scars, right? And
[3:59] that is what constitutes organizational
[4:02] context. It's the um it's the learnings
[4:06] along the way, the why did we do things
[4:09] the way we did it.
[4:13] And now you're good at your job because
[4:15] uh after all of that experience of pain,
[4:19] now you know what questions to ask. You
[4:21] know where to look when an incident
[4:23] happens. And this is the goal. This is
[4:26] what we want to get for our AI agents.
[4:31] So um I'm going to just lift this
[4:34] adoption curve from Vimath. And uh I I
[4:38] may have butchered his last name, but
[4:39] sorry uh Vim if you see this. Um so
[4:44] let's let's start at the beginning here.
[4:46] This was like four years ago in 2022.
[4:49] Everyone everyone remembers fancy
[4:51] autocomplete, right? Um so back in those
[4:55] days context windows and AI were pretty
[4:58] limited. I'm not sure if everyone even
[5:00] remembers this, but it was like 8
[5:01] kilobytes or or 8k tokens I should say.
[5:04] And that's not a ton. And so tokens were
[5:08] highly optimized and um agentic idees
[5:11] like cursor focused just on the code
[5:14] that surrounded uh the code that you
[5:17] wanted to go in and autocomplete. So
[5:19] basically they took some code before
[5:21] they took some code after they put it
[5:22] into a model and they said this user is
[5:25] working on this piece of code what's the
[5:26] most likely next thing and that's what
[5:28] was printed out. Um it got progressively
[5:32] better than that. as were uh were
[5:35] integrated uh language servers and then
[5:37] it you you were able to basically pull
[5:39] like collers of source code and pull all
[5:42] that into context and then the LLMs were
[5:44] really good at at completing uh code. Um
[5:49] so
[5:50] at those levels you were the context
[5:53] engine and uh in in many in many
[5:56] circumstances here this is kind of where
[6:00] most people are here. They're at the uh
[6:03] uh parallel agents hooked up with MCP
[6:06] and skills. Okay. Just super curious,
[6:11] has anyone gone beyond curated context
[6:14] into the the last uh few degrees of of
[6:18] agentic freedom, shall we say, where you
[6:21] have background agents running in the
[6:23] cloud doing stuff in YOLO mode. Is
[6:26] anyone anyone experimenting with that?
[6:28] Okay, cool. That's that's very cool.
[6:30] That's bleeding edge. Um, but let's just
[6:33] take a moment to recognize that bleeding
[6:36] edge today is like yesterday's news in
[6:38] six months. Okay. So, the the puck I'm
[6:42] Canadian, so I'm going to say this, the
[6:43] puck is going down down the line towards
[6:46] background agents for sure. Um, and one
[6:50] of the things that we run into right now
[6:52] is this. Uh, we're becoming the
[6:54] bottleneck as humans, right? I'm not
[6:56] sure if if people have tried managing
[6:58] parallel agents and uh working on
[7:01] several tasks at once, but everyone's
[7:02] starting to feel this like cognitive
[7:04] disconnect because you're context
[7:06] switching all the time and it's just
[7:07] it's just really really painful. Um, it
[7:10] is very difficult to move from that mode
[7:13] where you're the human managing context
[7:16] into the background agents mode unless
[7:18] you have some kind of context engine
[7:21] that knows how your code operates, how
[7:23] your organization works and understands
[7:25] the motivations for historical changes
[7:27] and things like that.
[7:31] So, Andrew, Andre, he nailed it. Um,
[7:35] systems are intelligent. We're reaching
[7:37] the exponential on on intelligence for
[7:40] code pretty soon. Everyone's seen the
[7:42] the release about Mythos. Um even though
[7:45] we all haven't had a chance to really
[7:47] try it out yet. Uh the promise is that
[7:49] from a code intelligence perspective,
[7:51] this thing is like pretty much close to
[7:53] to perfect. Um but so now the bottleneck
[7:57] is context. Of course,
[8:00] without um without context, I'm just
[8:02] going to re-emphasize this point. you'll
[8:04] probably end up in doom loops. Does
[8:07] everyone know what a doom loop is? A
[8:09] doom loop is like when you're uh you're
[8:12] struggling with the agent. It's it's not
[8:14] quite doing what you want and you have
[8:15] to keep iterating on it. The worst case
[8:18] scenario is you run this thing in yolo
[8:20] mode and it finishes the entire task and
[8:22] it's completely wrong. You have to go
[8:24] back and correct, you know, various
[8:26] stages. Um so when you have a context
[8:29] engine, you can get there faster. The
[8:31] problem is that access doesn't equal
[8:35] understanding.
[8:36] So we have customers that are on various
[8:39] parts of I'm just going to go back to
[8:40] here. We have customers that are on
[8:42] various parts of this journey.
[8:44] Um and one of the one of the interesting
[8:47] things that we've noted is that uh
[8:49] people feel that you know they're
[8:51] they're they understand their
[8:53] organization best. So when it comes to
[8:56] feeding the right context to these
[8:58] agents, people will try to build some
[9:00] semblance of what a context engine
[9:02] actually is. They'll maybe build a rag
[9:05] system or they'll build some way to like
[9:07] feed organizational data to an agent. Um
[9:11] so unfortunately though, uh access
[9:13] doesn't mean understanding. So, what
[9:15] that means is you could just wire up a
[9:17] bunch of MCP servers. Um, and it's not
[9:21] going to be able to understand what the
[9:23] relationships are uh between all that
[9:26] data, how it was, how it got there, and
[9:29] how why it is the way it is. Um, and
[9:31] then there's another problem which I'll
[9:32] talk about a little bit later called
[9:35] satisfaction of search. So, just
[9:36] remember that term. I'll come back to
[9:37] it. Um, okay.
[9:43] So I just wanted to show you this. Um
[9:45] this was something that uh we actually
[9:48] implemented and we did it in in two
[9:51] parts. One was just without any context
[9:54] engine but wired up to a bunch of MCP
[9:56] servers. It did a pretty good job. Um
[9:58] but then when we reached the end um it
[10:02] it it missed the fact that we had some
[10:05] legacy stuff that depended on this old
[10:08] um method of um of intelligence size to
[10:12] to anthropics. So they have adaptive
[10:14] thinking now but it used to be you had
[10:16] to supply a a token budget and that's
[10:19] how like you could increase the size of
[10:21] the thinking window. Um, so we we had
[10:24] some code that kind of like depended on
[10:26] this and there were reasons for that um
[10:29] that the agent didn't understand or see
[10:31] and so it just basically clogged all
[10:33] that code. Um, but when we added the
[10:35] context engine then it saw all those
[10:37] reasons and implemented it the right
[10:40] way. So it made the appropriate changes
[10:41] in the right places, included backwards
[10:43] compatibility for the code that was
[10:44] using the old method.
[10:48] Okay, so now for the myths.
[10:51] Myth one, naive rag over my docs is a
[10:54] context engine. Um, so
[10:58] if you implement um say like vector
[11:01] search um or just a couple of search
[11:03] methods
[11:05] uh you're going to run into this you're
[11:06] going to run into a few issues. One is
[11:08] this satisfaction of search problem
[11:10] where uh the agent will search like
[11:12] crazy consume your tokens and then in
[11:14] the worst case you'll reach compaction.
[11:17] Okay. So, um without being able to find
[11:20] the the endgame,
[11:23] um there are a few different other
[11:25] techniques like you you need to have
[11:27] personalization when you build a
[11:29] retrieval system because if you just rag
[11:32] all your data, especially for very large
[11:34] organizations, there's going to be
[11:36] things like conflicts that you have to
[11:38] resolve in the data. Um it won't be
[11:40] focused on the task that you're trying
[11:42] to perform. it might pull in, you know,
[11:45] relevant code from other parts of your
[11:47] organization that especially if if you
[11:49] have a really big org and you've got
[11:51] tons of different repos. Um, it's it's
[11:53] just going to create a huge mess. So,
[11:55] you need to have some element of
[11:56] personalization.
[11:59] And then here again, connect a bunch of
[12:01] MCPs. I'm just going to reiterate this
[12:03] point. I'm done. Nope, definitely not.
[12:05] Um, so that that is the thing that that
[12:08] really um puts an emphasis on the
[12:10] satisfaction of search point. And I'll
[12:12] explain that in a sec.
[12:15] And finally, a bigger context window
[12:18] will solve this. Um, so way back, you
[12:22] know, when the models were starting to
[12:24] get big, people were really excited
[12:25] about a million tokens in your context
[12:28] window. Uh, the first models that tried
[12:30] this, I think it might have been Claude,
[12:32] actually. Was it Claude?
[12:33] >> I think it was
[12:36] >> or OpenAI. Okay. Okay. Gemini.
[12:37] >> Gemini. Yes. Sorry. I'm so sorry. Um, so
[12:40] yeah, Gemini first first model to try
[12:43] this and it was really good at finding
[12:44] needle in the hay stack. So you could
[12:46] feed like a huge document to it and as
[12:49] long as you you knew what you were
[12:51] looking for ahead of time, it could find
[12:53] it. Um, but it wasn't good at all at
[12:57] reasoning across different data sources,
[13:00] um, understanding the real meaning
[13:02] behind a problem and then recommending
[13:04] the appropriate solutions. So none of
[13:06] that was possible. Um, obviously things
[13:09] have things have gotten much better.
[13:11] Now, the problem is most organizations
[13:13] have more than a million tokens worth of
[13:15] context. So, trying to fit all that into
[13:18] the context window isn't going to work
[13:19] anyways. Let's project out to the future
[13:21] and imagine that you could fit like 10
[13:23] million tokens, 50 million tokens. Um,
[13:26] at the current uh rate of memory
[13:29] consumption um just to operate the
[13:31] models, that's not going to be possible
[13:32] for a really long time. even if it was
[13:35] and you fit all that context in your
[13:37] context window, you're still going to
[13:39] run into problems with understanding
[13:41] what's true, what's false, um how to
[13:45] select the right information. Okay, so
[13:47] now I'm going to come back to this
[13:49] second point here, satisfaction of
[13:51] search. This is a a term that actually
[13:55] comes out of uh the medical field in
[13:57] radiology. And the idea is that um when
[14:00] techs are looking at x-rays uh and
[14:03] they're looking for uh the cause of of
[14:05] of symptoms, they might find something
[14:08] on the x-ray that explains those
[14:10] symptoms and then they stop. Um and
[14:15] that's that's kind of like a dangerous
[14:16] thing medically because uh there might
[14:19] be other indicators for things like
[14:21] cancer that get missed. So, uh,
[14:24] satisfaction of search is a is a real
[14:25] problem in radiology and there's lots of
[14:27] protocols to prevent just stopping as
[14:30] soon as you find the first thing. Um,
[14:32] this is what happens with agents when
[14:35] they search around in say uh, notion and
[14:38] your code uh, confluence, they'll
[14:41] stumble across what looks like the the
[14:43] thing they're looking for and they'll
[14:45] stop and then they'll they'll proceed.
[14:47] But the the real like golden nuggets of
[14:49] information might be in a different
[14:51] place that the agent wouldn't think to
[14:52] look like in a in a past Slack
[14:55] conversation or in an incident report,
[14:57] something like that.
[15:00] So here's the the classic iceberg meme.
[15:03] Um
[15:05] code that compiles. That's like the
[15:06] baseline. Does the agent produce code
[15:09] that compiles? Um but everything that
[15:11] that is actually important is happens
[15:14] underneath here. So understanding the
[15:16] user's original intent um what was
[15:19] rejected in the past by the team and
[15:21] tried before but failed. Uh how are you
[15:24] going to surface that kind of content
[15:26] just by looking at docs and and code and
[15:28] stuff? Um so you need to understand that
[15:31] somehow.
[15:34] Um and even worse like it it's it's
[15:37] sometimes hard to know uh when things
[15:40] were deleted like in the absence of
[15:41] information. So you need history as well
[15:43] leading up to decisions.
[15:48] So this is why we think you need a
[15:51] context engine. Uh a context engine
[15:54] understands who you are, what team you
[15:57] work on, who you work with, who the
[16:00] experts are in your organization,
[16:03] um and and what the decisions were that
[16:05] led up to the current iteration of your
[16:08] codebase. it's able to resolve
[16:11] conflicts. Uh so this is like a truth
[16:13] and false type situation. What's true,
[16:15] what's not. Um sometimes that truthiness
[16:19] is a gray area, right? So the context
[16:21] engine needs to also understand when to
[16:24] instruct the agent um that it wasn't
[16:27] able to resolve a conflict and then uh
[16:30] learn from additional user input.
[16:34] Um this third point is super important
[16:36] of course in any large organization or
[16:38] enterprise. Um there's often you know
[16:41] repositories that not everybody can
[16:43] access secret projects that sort of
[16:45] thing. So uh it's really important that
[16:47] you flow the access controls up. We have
[16:50] I'll give you an example that everyone
[16:52] will appreciate which is Slack. Um our
[16:55] contact engine integrates with Slack or
[16:58] Microsoft Teams. Um, and when you have
[17:01] uh private channels that that's really
[17:03] highly sensitive, right? Like you could
[17:05] be discussing HR information or uh maybe
[17:08] something that you just really don't
[17:09] want um everyone else to see. And so
[17:13] when when unblocked answers questions,
[17:16] uh it will use private channel
[17:17] information, but it won't it it will
[17:19] only use that information if the person
[17:21] that's asking the question has access to
[17:23] it. And then those answers are not
[17:25] public. Okay? So they're they're private
[17:28] to you.
[17:30] Um, and then finally, of course,
[17:33] delivering the right contest at the
[17:34] right time. And this is about token
[17:36] efficiency. It's about getting to the
[17:38] answer as quickly as possible.
[17:41] So, here's a kind of a highlevel
[17:43] overview of how how a context engine
[17:46] might work. Um, on the left we've got
[17:48] data source inputs. So, things like
[17:51] planning tools, docs, conversations,
[17:52] code, PRs, basically like anything
[17:54] that's relevant to getting work done at
[17:57] the engineering level. Um and then on
[18:00] the right side we have the outputs. So
[18:02] you know th this all can flow to coding
[18:05] agents CP or CLI tools. Um you can
[18:10] custom build apps through the API. We've
[18:12] got a we have a code review uh component
[18:15] that just plugs right into your SCM and
[18:17] provides code reviews and of course uh
[18:19] integrations with social messaging apps.
[18:24] So the these are the kind of like broad
[18:27] six requirements that we think are
[18:29] important. There's actually much more
[18:31] than this but these are the highle
[18:32] things. So again unified system contexts
[18:37] um this is about
[18:39] building relationships between data.
[18:41] Okay. But it's more than just um
[18:45] recognizing when uh one piece of data is
[18:49] related to another. Like for example, in
[18:51] in Slack, you might have conversations
[18:52] about PRs. That's an easy linkage
[18:55] because posting links back and forth. So
[18:58] that's easy. Um what's less easy is
[19:00] understanding uh the reason why
[19:02] decisions were made or your
[19:05] organization's best practices, right? So
[19:08] to understand that you have to go a
[19:10] little deeper. um do do things like
[19:12] distill um historical poll request
[19:16] comments on PRs and uh try to distill
[19:20] those down to the their core essence and
[19:22] then when you see repeated patterns uh
[19:25] you can pull those patterns together and
[19:27] store them as you know quote unquote
[19:29] memories so that when uh someone is
[19:32] working on a similar piece of code you
[19:34] can load those memories and then the
[19:36] agent can see that and go oh yeah right
[19:38] uh this is the way this organization
[19:40] does this particular thing.
[19:43] Um, conflict resolution super important.
[19:47] Um, we took a initially kind of a naive
[19:51] approach to this at first and based it
[19:54] just on recency, right? So, we we would
[19:56] bias towards newer stuff. Uh,
[19:59] unfortunately, when you have in the
[20:02] fullness of all your context, recency is
[20:04] not enough. Um, often you have people
[20:08] um, writing documents or chatting in in
[20:12] in their messaging platforms and they
[20:15] might be saying things that are not like
[20:18] completely aligned with uh, how the the
[20:20] system works. Um, uh, so you know then
[20:24] we started to bias towards code. So, we
[20:26] had recency and we're like the main
[20:28] branch is definitely your source of
[20:30] truth, but not always because sometimes
[20:34] um what's important is what happens
[20:36] next, not the way a system currently
[20:38] works. Like when when you're working on
[20:40] a task um what you really want is for
[20:44] the agent to understand where you're
[20:46] going, not necessarily where you've
[20:48] been. Where you've been helps it
[20:51] understand what not to do. where you're
[20:53] going helps it understand what you
[20:55] should do. Okay. So, in in the Slack
[20:58] case, looking at the conversations that
[21:00] your organization's experts are having
[21:03] is more important than just
[21:05] understanding what you know, every
[21:07] random engineer is talking about.
[21:10] Um, targeted retrieval and personal
[21:13] relevance are very related. So, I'll
[21:15] just talk about them uh together
[21:17] briefly. So, um, again, like when you're
[21:23] pulling context in, it's important that,
[21:25] uh, you're only pulling context in for
[21:27] the relevant task at hand and probably
[21:30] relevant to you. So, here's a technique
[21:32] that's kind of interesting. um you can
[21:34] understand what repos a person works on
[21:37] most by the number of PRs they submit
[21:40] contributions and then if you do a if
[21:43] you're doing vector retrieval you can do
[21:45] a uh deep retrieval on those focused
[21:48] repositories and then a wider retrieval
[21:51] on you know the rest of the source code
[21:53] and then sort of bias the the selection
[21:56] towards uh the focused repositories
[21:58] because that's more likely where
[21:59] someone's going to be working and
[22:01] spending their
[22:03] Um, and then you know, we've talked
[22:06] about data governance, so I don't think
[22:07] I need to go over that again. Super
[22:09] important though.
[22:13] This was just a a little experiment that
[22:16] we ran uh with a larger task. Um, I'm I
[22:20] fully admit that some of these numbers
[22:21] are a bit wonky. This is basically like
[22:23] Claude outputting numbers. So, don't
[22:25] don't trust it. Just trust the the vibe
[22:28] of the thing and not necessarily the
[22:29] numbers. Um, basically what it's saying
[22:32] is that when we started out uh without
[22:35] the MCP server act or sorry without the
[22:38] context engine active um it it really
[22:40] missed the mark on a lot of stuff. Uh
[22:43] and that's just because it didn't
[22:44] understand how um the existing
[22:47] implementation really worked and why it
[22:49] was the way it was, what was tried
[22:51] before and failed. Um and so it made a
[22:54] lot of those same mistakes. uh with a
[22:56] context engine turned turned on
[22:58] obviously it it um it nailed it. The the
[23:01] key numbers though are the the time and
[23:03] the tokens that it took. So without um
[23:08] the context engine took two and a half
[23:09] hours to finish this task with 21
[23:12] million tokens which is a lot of tokens.
[23:15] Um but with the context engine it took
[23:17] only 25 minutes and 10 million tokens.
[23:20] So it's it's a pretty dramatic
[23:22] difference.
[23:23] Um okay so the hard lessons these are
[23:26] just samples by the way but the these
[23:29] are ones that we thought were kind of
[23:30] interesting. So first of all uh
[23:33] initially we optimized for access not
[23:36] understanding. So we our our first
[23:38] premise was if we just wire up a bunch
[23:39] of tools
[23:41] um and provide a a knowledge graph it
[23:44] will be able to traverse the knowledge
[23:46] graph and uh execute a bunch of
[23:49] retrieval specific tools for particular
[23:51] integrations and so on and figure
[23:54] everything out. Um that does not work.
[23:57] So uh you'll have to go a little bit
[24:00] deeper than that.
[24:04] Uh second one is we hid conflicts
[24:06] instead of surfacing them. So um by con
[24:09] by hiding conflicts I don't mean that we
[24:11] just ignored the conflicts. What we did
[24:14] instead was we tried to resolve those
[24:17] conflicts using those naive strategies
[24:20] and we didn't surface the conflicts that
[24:23] we weren't able to resolve. So this was
[24:25] a really good learning is that um a
[24:28] context engine I mean we'll get there
[24:30] eventually probably but uh it can't
[24:32] always tell uh what the truth elements
[24:35] are and when it can't you should surface
[24:37] that and learn from it. That's the key
[24:39] thing.
[24:42] And then finally I think a lot of folks
[24:45] tried this. This is a really bad idea.
[24:48] So when when a context engine supplies
[24:50] an answer um do not cache the answer and
[24:54] try to serve that same answer up again
[24:56] uh to a similar question. The reason is
[24:58] obvious is is fairly obvious in
[24:59] retrospect but um everything changes
[25:02] constantly right code changes docs
[25:05] change the reason for things change. So
[25:07] this just doesn't work. Um the other
[25:10] thing is if you try to uh use the the
[25:15] previous answers as context for new
[25:17] answers, you regress towards a mean. So
[25:20] if the model is like misbehaving or
[25:22] doing something bad and you continuously
[25:25] bring that into context, you're
[25:26] obviously going to pollute uh the
[25:28] context.
[25:32] And this is what happens.
[25:36] Okay. So let's now talk about where AI
[25:39] forward teams like like those that are
[25:41] doing this like cloud-based agent thing
[25:43] are are using and taking advantage of
[25:45] context engines.
[25:47] Um definitely and especially during the
[25:49] planning phase. Okay, this is where you
[25:52] get the biggest bang for buck
[25:54] unquestionably. Um get the context
[25:57] engine involved, use a skill to bring it
[26:00] in. Um connect it to the MCP server and
[26:03] and watch it do its thing. it. This is
[26:05] where you get the biggest bang for buck.
[26:07] It's also useful to do this during
[26:09] review. So you get planning and review
[26:11] at the end. Um because you know if if
[26:14] you get an agent to do review, it's
[26:17] basically just going to pay attention to
[26:19] the code and try to understand where the
[26:21] break points are um security concerns,
[26:24] that kind of thing. But without the
[26:26] organizational context, it doesn't
[26:28] understand the motivation for it. So
[26:29] that's the really important thing.
[26:32] Pick enrichment. Um, this is a a super
[26:35] cool use case. So, you create a ticket
[26:38] for a new feature and then you just ask
[26:40] the agent that's connected to a context
[26:42] engine to fill in the blanks. Works.
[26:47] Triage. Uh, I use this all the time.
[26:49] When I see an issue in production, I
[26:51] just whack it into an agent connect to
[26:53] the context engine and it just like
[26:55] instantly brings up all the past issues
[26:58] related to this and um, starts operating
[27:01] right away.
[27:04] Increasingly we're seeing this one
[27:05] incident management. Okay. So we we just
[27:08] uh wired up data dog and this sorry
[27:13] >> sentry and data dog sorry. Um and this
[27:16] is already proving like super cool use
[27:18] case. It uh it can see the signals and
[27:23] then it can act on all the signals and
[27:25] relate that to code uh relate it to past
[27:28] incidents that you and discussions that
[27:30] you've had in Slack. Having all those
[27:32] things come together at once is is
[27:34] almost like magical. And finally, I
[27:36] think this one's actually my favorite
[27:37] one and it's the one that customers use
[27:40] the most is uh customer success and
[27:42] sales and engineering support. So what
[27:46] what a lot of big teams do is they have
[27:48] engineering support channels where other
[27:50] teams can come in and ask questions. If
[27:52] you put a context engine into one of
[27:54] these things, you can have it
[27:56] automatically answer a lot of questions
[27:58] and save engineers a ton of time.
[28:02] All right. So, how teams make a context
[28:05] engine their own skills. So, definitely
[28:08] build uh skills that you can use to
[28:11] curate context in a GitHub repo.
[28:14] Um and you can build other skills around
[28:16] it like typing ticket enrich give it the
[28:20] issue ID and then it it can use the
[28:23] context engine to build the enrichment.
[28:28] uh workflows like this one prepare
[28:29] prepare an incident timeline um and then
[28:32] you can just send it off to your agent
[28:34] again context engine blah blah blah
[28:35] brings everything together magical
[28:39] and this thing here um you can wire this
[28:42] up to all kinds of agents I've got um uh
[28:45] one one of the things that a lot of
[28:47] customers like to do is wire this up to
[28:49] claude code in their CI system um we
[28:52] actually do have a code review component
[28:54] so you don't have to do this if you're
[28:55] using unblocked Um, but people use this
[28:59] for other things, not just code review.
[29:00] As soon as you wire up a context engine
[29:02] in the background, give it an API key,
[29:05] let it let it run on its own, it it can
[29:07] do some pretty insane stuff. Um, so I'm
[29:10] just going to show a quick
[29:12] um
[29:15] example of what wiring up a context
[29:18] engine can do. So this is a PR that uh
[29:21] my colleague wrote and uh it it
[29:25] unblocked like went through and provided
[29:27] a a kind of review to this thing and at
[29:30] the bottom of this review here's the
[29:32] review part. Um you can see that Richie
[29:36] who was the author of this PR was like
[29:38] very cool this is something I would say.
[29:40] Uh now the reason for the comment which
[29:42] was you've basically duplicated a bunch
[29:44] of tests you can you can kind of dry
[29:46] that up a little bit is because um this
[29:50] was a best practice that was distilled
[29:52] from a bunch of other PRs and the the
[29:55] funny part is that the author of those
[29:57] PRs was Richie. So he's the one that
[30:00] actually instilled the best practice in
[30:02] the organization. Uh so that was that
[30:05] was just a cool little moment when we
[30:06] discovered that. Um, here's another
[30:09] example. So, this was a it's a fairly
[30:11] long transcript. I'm not going to like
[30:13] show the whole thing, but we we sent it
[30:15] on a on a mission to do a big large
[30:18] task. Without uh unblocked, it it uh
[30:21] took quite a while. Like you can see
[30:23] transcripts quite long. Um, and it it
[30:26] missed a whole bunch of stuff. With
[30:29] unblocked, uh, it was a lot more
[30:31] compact. It it got to the answer like
[30:34] very quickly and correctly. And just
[30:36] because we're now AI forward and lazy,
[30:40] um, we took both of those transcripts
[30:42] and ran them into Claude and just said,
[30:44] "Hey, Claude, why don't you just do a an
[30:46] analysis of both these things and give
[30:48] us your give us your result." Um, so it
[30:50] it went through I won't, you know, bore
[30:53] you with the details, but just to say
[30:55] that at the end, the verdict is that uh
[30:57] the context engine plan is is what I'd
[31:00] ship with. This other one is good for a
[31:03] prototype, but it's missing a whole
[31:04] bunch of stuff that is important to this
[31:06] organization. It was previously
[31:08] discussed. Okay,
[31:14] so this is essentially what what I've
[31:18] been trying to say. Uh AI generated code
[31:21] should just feel like it was written by
[31:22] someone that's been in your team for
[31:24] like 20 years. Okay. Um it doesn't if it
[31:28] doesn't yet, that's fine. Um it will um
[31:33] you're if you wire up unblocked you'll
[31:35] you'll see like a a huge difference in
[31:37] performance of agents and if you're
[31:39] building one of these things absolutely
[31:41] like take all these things and and build
[31:43] and and let's see where that goes.
[31:47] So just before we get into the workshop
[31:49] component um maybe we'll just have like
[31:52] five 10 minutes of Q&A.
[31:57] >> I'm Brandon
[31:58] >> and this is Brandon. So he'll he'll help
[31:59] with
[32:00] >> this.
[32:06] >> Thanks. Um, so it's clear what it does
[32:08] for you and what kind of problems it
[32:10] solves? But to me, a big question mark
[32:12] is what is the thing? What is the
[32:14] artifact that that fits the bill? Is it
[32:18] like a program you install, an API
[32:20] that's hosted remotely, or an MCP
[32:23] server? What is it?
[32:25] >> It's it's all of those things. So, a a
[32:27] context engine, I'll explain what
[32:29] unblocked is. Maybe I can just show a
[32:31] quick demo of it. Um, so broadly
[32:34] speaking, there's a bunch of different
[32:36] surfaces to a context engine. You want
[32:39] to get it into your agent flow, and you
[32:41] can do that with an MCP server. You can
[32:43] do that with a CLI tool, for example.
[32:47] Um, we also have this dashboard surface
[32:50] where you can ask questions about your
[32:52] code. Um, this is a pretty basic one,
[32:54] but you can see it understands who I am
[32:56] and what I've been working on. Um, and
[32:59] then, uh, we have a Slack, we have Slack
[33:02] connectivity as well. So, you can bring
[33:04] unblocked into Slack. Um, drive it in
[33:07] conversations and have it auto answer
[33:09] things. Does that make sense? Did I
[33:11] answer your question or
[33:18] >> Okay.
[33:19] >> Yes. API, CLI, MC.
[33:21] >> Yeah.
[33:24] Yeah,
[33:26] >> sorry.
[33:29] >> Thank you. Um, so my question is, so as
[33:33] far as I understand is like a knowledge
[33:35] management and retrieval um application.
[33:39] >> Yeah. And does this relate somehow to
[33:42] things like um LLM wiki like it was made
[33:46] popular recently by Andre Karpati or the
[33:50] decision traces and context graphs
[33:53] >> which was discussed a lot a few months
[33:56] ago.
[33:56] >> Yeah. So you can think of all of those
[33:58] things as kind of uh useful components
[34:02] to a context engine. A context engine
[34:05] has to do much more than that because um
[34:07] so agents are really good at recursing
[34:09] through a wiki for example. Depends on
[34:12] how you build this wiki because there's
[34:13] a bunch of things like organizational
[34:15] memories, best practices, you know,
[34:18] experts in your organization and that
[34:20] are used as pivot points for context
[34:23] retrieval. So a a wiki doesn't solve
[34:26] those problems unless it has like a you
[34:28] know you could build a structure with
[34:30] it. And I think uh Carpathy discovered
[34:33] that if you treat a wiki as um kind of
[34:37] like a file system, you can break it
[34:38] down and have the agent uh whack through
[34:41] it like a file system. They're by the
[34:43] way, agents are like highly optimized
[34:45] for file system traversal.
[34:47] >> Yeah. The compilation step. Exactly.
[34:50] >> Yeah. Yeah, sorry.
[34:54] Sorry, maybe the same question, but is
[34:56] it is it a general purpose context
[34:59] engine or is it targeted against uh code
[35:02] because will it be useful as a say uh as
[35:06] a business domain expert uh or sort of
[35:10] building up a business domain and then
[35:12] having this context engine use my so I
[35:15] could all my other I agents could use
[35:18] this as context for the business. uh or
[35:21] would you say that is more like just for
[35:23] the code part of it?
[35:24] >> Uh so it it's definitely engineering
[35:27] focused the the integrations are focused
[35:29] on engineering activities. So you know
[35:32] SCM integrations and other other tools
[35:35] that engineers use um we are
[35:39] increasingly seeing customers using it
[35:41] for other purposes. So business
[35:43] intelligence is a key thing. Uh and
[35:46] that's usually useful when uh people in
[35:49] in business functions are trying to get
[35:51] an understanding of the product and its
[35:53] function. Um we don't have uh like say
[35:57] Salesforce integrations wired up for
[35:59] that. So you couldn't use it to
[36:02] understand um you know any anything
[36:05] that's salesreated. It's it's really
[36:07] primarily an engineering focused context
[36:09] engine. That's not to say that that
[36:10] won't change.
[36:17] Yeah,
[36:19] >> on the governance thing, if you're
[36:21] >> um respecting access rights, how can it
[36:24] do sort of synthesis across stuff and
[36:27] then develop new knowledge inter
[36:30] internally that it could then surface to
[36:32] people?
[36:33] >> So that yes, you're correct to point
[36:34] that out. The the synthesis um is
[36:37] compartmentalized.
[36:39] So there are, you know, places that are
[36:41] compartmentalized like individual
[36:43] repositories. That's kind of the level
[36:45] of access. So if you can synthesize uh
[36:48] historical data based off of that um and
[36:51] then correlate that with public Slack
[36:54] information, then that's that's one way
[36:56] to do synthesis without crossing the the
[36:58] organizational boundaries. Um so
[37:03] uh the you know the other way is to look
[37:05] at and tag when um synthesized
[37:10] information crosses those organizational
[37:12] boundaries and you can take something
[37:14] like a group ID approach to that problem
[37:17] where you attach group ID tags to the
[37:20] synthesized information and then only
[37:22] retrieve it if the person that uh has
[37:25] access to that can can build it out. So
[37:28] first take the compartmentalized
[37:29] approach because that's the where you'll
[37:31] get the the most mileage and then you
[37:33] kind of build up from there. I mean this
[37:35] is the core problem with using a
[37:37] technology like graph rag right because
[37:40] graph rag is like a pyramid where it
[37:43] builds up in layers and then basically
[37:45] summarizes each layer but that like
[37:48] unavoidably crosses uh permissions
[37:50] boundaries. So you have to be you have
[37:52] to create compartmentalized pockets.
[37:55] Yeah.
[37:58] It's a good question.
[38:03] >> Yeah.
[38:04] >> Yes. You've talked a lot about like all
[38:07] the different sources of information
[38:08] that you consume and putting them all
[38:10] together. When it's like synthesizing
[38:12] those down, is that still sort of like
[38:15] naive rag, vector search, all that stuff
[38:17] under the hood? Or is it like agents
[38:19] deciding what is appropriate? like what
[38:21] what or probably like combinations of
[38:23] all of them, but what is that sort of
[38:25] step?
[38:26] >> Um yeah, you're right. It is a
[38:28] combination of all of them. So knowledge
[38:30] graph like knowledge graph buildup
[38:32] happens in a bunch of different ways.
[38:34] >> Um the the PR thing that I showed you
[38:36] for example is like a first you build a
[38:40] a naive knowledge graph procedurally and
[38:42] then from there you can use an LLM to
[38:44] distill down and summarize and build up
[38:46] um those types of techniques. Um our
[38:51] context engine builds first like a
[38:54] knowledge graph from the base uh using
[38:57] trying to leverage like all the
[38:58] different entities. It's kind of like a
[38:59] page rank thing where it builds up the
[39:02] relationships procedurally and then of
[39:04] course it vectorizes data. Um and then
[39:07] there are procedural tools that fetch
[39:10] data at runtime. Um a lot of the
[39:13] distillation for uh you know conflict
[39:16] resolution happens in two places. So one
[39:19] is like during data ingestion time
[39:22] there's there are tags that relate data
[39:25] to each other so that we can see if we
[39:26] can deconlict at that level and then
[39:28] like rank against each other at that
[39:30] level and then of course at runtime you
[39:32] have to pass the things to a judge with
[39:35] the criteria um and then it does
[39:38] additional deconliction in real time.
[39:41] >> Does that make sense?
[39:42] >> Yeah.
[39:42] >> Okay.
[39:43] >> One more question. So uh I was curious
[39:46] you said conflicts but at some point you
[39:48] get conflicts that something means
[39:49] revenue for one company and means
[39:51] revenue for another company isn't a
[39:52] totally different meaning how you can
[39:55] recognize that so how do you get humans
[39:58] in the loop how how do you use their
[39:59] ontologies and how can you do you use it
[40:03] when you run into it so I'm very curious
[40:05] about that actually how how
[40:07] >> yeah so if you I can show you just a
[40:09] quick thing here so um you'll notice
[40:11] that at the bottom the the references
[40:13] that were used for answers are delivered
[40:16] both like to the human in this interface
[40:18] but also to the agent. So um if the
[40:22] agent if the context engine isn't able
[40:25] to do the deconliction then at this
[40:27] point here the human can step in and
[40:30] guide the agent when there are enough s
[40:35] >> so you can you can literally just reply
[40:36] and say like that's not correct or you
[40:38] can come here
[40:40] >> and
[40:41] >> oh yeah sorry
[40:42] >> yeah or you can you can do this like not
[40:45] helpful and and give the reason why um
[40:47] like it is a bit of a manual process at
[40:50] this stage, but the signals that build
[40:52] up over time,
[40:54] >> it's funny, right?
[40:56] You might have catch a lot of human
[40:59] intelligence by this, right?
[41:00] >> Yeah, that's amazing.
[41:03] >> Yeah, for a typical customer, how much
[41:06] do you have that metric?
[41:08] >> Oh, it's huge. It's it's it's amazing.
[41:10] Like I I was actually really surprised
[41:12] by how willing people are to give
[41:15] feedback. Um, yeah. No, it's
[41:17] >> can you
[41:20] thousands or hundreds
[41:22] of
[41:25] >> I mean at at small team size it's you
[41:28] know in the hundreds at so small team
[41:30] size being like 20 30 people at large
[41:33] team size 100 to 200 people it's like
[41:36] hundreds and hundreds of
[41:37] >> oh wow
[41:38] >> of feedback. Yeah
[41:40] >> people just really like to interact with
[41:42] agents and tell them in natural language
[41:44] what's wrong. It's It's just a totally
[41:46] natural thing to do.
[41:48] >> Yeah.
[41:51] >> Cool. All right. Um are we are we good
[41:55] for Q&A
[41:57] >> and then we can get on
[41:57] >> ask questions as we hack. But
[41:59] >> yeah, let's let's get on to the let's
[42:01] get on to the workshop part of this. So
[42:03] um we have created a um for actually
[42:07] what I'll do is I'll just do this first.
[42:10] So you can do this now if you'd like. Um
[42:13] I will come back to this slide in a sec.
[42:15] So the idea here is we're going to get
[42:17] everyone to join a Slack workspace that
[42:19] we created and then we're going to get
[42:22] uh everyone into a repo where this um
[42:25] where this sample code lives and then
[42:27] we'll just start hacking away on it
[42:28] together. Okay.
[42:37] >> Yeah.
[42:50] I got some people coming.
[42:52] >> Nice.
[42:52] >> When you drop in, you'll see an AI
[42:54] engineering London channel. Hopefully
[42:58] there's a link to
[43:02] this drop
[43:06] and
[43:07] >> the unblocked link will not work until
[43:09] you do step two. Yes.
[43:11] >> To get into the GitHub or
[43:17] >> Oh, no.
[43:18] >> I've got I've got many people coming in.
[43:20] So, I'm really hopeful that
[43:22] >> is it network? Yeah.
[43:25] >> We will find out.
[43:26] >> Um, okay. While while folks are doing
[43:27] that, I'm just going to show you what
[43:29] we're getting into here. So, this is the
[43:32] uh GitHub organization. Um, what we're
[43:34] what we're working on is a social graph
[43:36] builder. So, what this is going to do is
[43:40] look at a source code repository. So,
[43:42] you can run this on your own repo. It's
[43:44] not going to upload anything. It's all
[43:46] local. Um, so that you can see this
[43:48] thing building up against your own
[43:50] organization.
[43:52] Um, and it's going to do a bunch of
[43:55] things. We're going to get basically a
[43:57] social graph out of it, and I'll show
[43:58] you what that looks like. And we're
[44:00] going to understand who the experts are
[44:02] and which parts of the code they work
[44:04] on. Um, and then there's going to be a
[44:06] little like interactive visualization
[44:08] thing. So, what what the goal of this
[44:10] exercise is is to get this thing up and
[44:12] running and start just start hacking
[44:14] away on it. So, like start submitting
[44:15] PRs as soon as uh we get this going. Um,
[44:22] so this is what it looks like.
[44:25] This graph here is our organization
[44:27] unblocked. And uh what you're seeing
[44:30] here is a a relationship graph that
[44:32] shows who's reviewing whose PRs um and
[44:36] who's who's getting reviewed.
[44:37] Essentially
[44:40] the uh this thing is
[44:44] a distillation of all the different
[44:46] teams within on blocks. So this is
[44:48] roughly accurate actually. Well, not
[44:50] roughly, it is pretty accurate. Um,
[44:53] we've got I I did this all the way back
[44:55] to the start of 25, 2025. When you run
[44:58] the thing, I'd recommend maybe doing it
[45:00] for a shorter timeline because it will
[45:02] be a little bit slow uh if you go all
[45:05] the way back to 25. Could take like 15
[45:07] minutes. Um, but it's effectively
[45:10] distilled who the teams are and um you
[45:14] the only AI step in this is to label the
[45:17] teams. You don't have to run the AI step
[45:19] if you don't want to. it'll just use the
[45:21] the parts of the code that people work
[45:22] on the most. Um, this tab here will show
[45:27] the experts in the organization and what
[45:29] they work on. So, this is just broken
[45:31] down by uh project area and path um and
[45:35] shows like what areas of the code have
[45:38] good coverage. coverage is defined
[45:40] mostly by whether a a high contributing
[45:43] organizational expert is present and
[45:46] whether uh it's it's an actively
[45:48] contributed to part of the code.
[45:50] And then finally uh we'll have this
[45:52] interactive graph that um breaks things
[45:55] down by team area and we'll show like
[45:59] you know who the major contributors are.
[46:01] I'm over here on the AI team. Um yeah,
[46:07] so that's it. Let's get everybody in and
[46:09] we'll start hacking away at this.
[46:13] >> Yes, absolutely.
[46:15] >> Yeah,
[46:17] >> many of you should have an invite who
[46:19] have put your GitHub already in. So,
[46:21] please give it a check. GitHub is the
[46:24] worst.
[46:26] >> Yeah,
[46:27] >> we will. It is an MIT license. We will
[46:29] be making it public later, but for now,
[46:31] we needed it locked down.
[46:35] Oh, did you still
[47:21] I'll show you.
[47:24] >> What have you done?
[47:39] I also slight.
[47:54] So, I think the the rest of this session
[47:56] is going to be now just like hacking
[47:58] away. So, um in a sec here, I think I'll
[48:01] I'll take this this down if everyone's
[48:04] got it. Um so, so that Brian and I can
[48:06] concentrate on working with you guys to
[48:08] build features.
[48:24] Oh, when you submit PRs, by the way,
[48:26] you'll notice that unblocked is sitting
[48:28] there as a code reviewer. So, don't
[48:29] don't feel badly if it uh sprays on your
[48:33] PR a little bit.
[48:36] >> Depends on how much
[49:10] You got one heck of username. Good work.
[49:21] >> Is Is everyone good with this? I take it
[49:23] down. Okay, cool.
[49:26] That is it.
[49:36] >> Brandon, you're you're on top of the
[49:38] invites. Okay, cool.
[49:39] >> There's a few more. I'm on to
[49:41] Chris
[49:45] has given two.
[49:48] >> That's okay. I'm gonna send both. Don't
[49:49] worry.
[49:52] >> That's just where I am in this list.
[50:41] Oh,
[50:42] forgot to mention a couple of things
[50:44] here actually.
[50:45] >> Yeah.
[50:53] >> Coming back live. Yeah, good. Um, just a
[50:56] couple of things. So if if uh you're
[50:59] looking for something to implement and
[51:04] starting with with any with coming up
[51:05] with ideas and stuff, there is a uh a
[51:08] set of sort of predefined issues that
[51:10] you can hack away on. So you can just
[51:11] grab one of these, whack it into Claude
[51:14] and see how it does when it's connected
[51:16] to the context engine.
[51:26] Um, the MCP server for unblocked is
[51:29] here. So, if you want instructions on
[51:31] how to wire this up to uh claw code or
[51:35] another agent, then you can grab it from
[51:37] the instructions from here.
[51:53] All right. So, I'm at Lars. There's two
[51:55] more in here. So, I'm still going, by
[51:56] the way, for those just adding
[53:21] What's going on, Brandon?
[53:23] >> Oh, sorry. Just one of the usernames is
[53:25] >> Oh, okay.
[53:37] You should have
[53:43] just behind
[53:47] Christopher, did you not get invited
[53:48] yet?
[53:49] >> No, I didn't.
[53:50] >> That's weird.
[53:51] >> Let me double check. You should have
[53:53] one, but
[53:57] >> yeah, I should. You should have an
[53:59] email. I'm up to like one of you. So
[54:03] hard.
[54:05] >> It's like five clicks to add a member.
[54:07] I'm like,
[54:11] >> I was going to say should be able to use
[54:12] the CLI for this. What's going on?
[54:15] >> That's right.
[54:16] >> No, they keep putting it in my PR and I
[54:18] don't want it there. Copilot's going to
[54:20] review for me
[54:23] >> very poorly, but it will
[54:42] question.
[54:43] >> Yeah, for sure.
[54:45] >> Do Hold on. Let me grab you the mic.
[54:54] >> Hopefully that's on.
[54:56] >> Does it work? Yes. Um, so I guess that
[54:59] context engine works very well for
[55:01] asynchronous agents so that you don't
[55:04] need to specify things on your keyboard
[55:07] because they can fetch what they need.
[55:09] That's one of the main uses I I guess.
[55:11] And
[55:12] >> um so it plays very well uh I think with
[55:16] agents like Copilot on GitHub. Do do you
[55:19] see uh if you can share it uh which
[55:23] agents are used most with unblocked
[55:26] whether it's more because on the wild as
[55:28] a developers with our laptops I think CL
[55:32] code is much more used than copilot but
[55:34] maybe you see a different picture.
[55:36] >> Okay so I'm going to take this off the
[55:38] screen for a secure
[55:41] >> and try to see if I can pull that up for
[55:43] you.
[55:45] Um, but the answer is yes, we do know
[55:49] roughly what that breakdown looks like.
[55:51] So, let me grab that.
[56:39] Okay.
[56:42] I think this gives you kind of the rough
[56:44] picture.
[56:55] >> Okay. So, this is kind of the rough the
[56:58] rough picture here. Um,
[57:01] unfortunately because of the way that
[57:03] this is I should probably like
[57:05] >> extend the screen, but I'll just step
[57:07] over here. So, uh, cloud code is by far
[57:12] the most used. Um, followed this is the
[57:15] the next one is cursor. So, that that
[57:17] seems fairly obvious. This last one here
[57:20] is kind of a catch-all, but what's
[57:21] really interesting is that a lot of
[57:22] people use cloud desktop, which which
[57:25] was very unexpected, but this is the
[57:28] case. Um, so, and then VS Code and
[57:31] Codeex account for a much smaller
[57:33] component, but yeah, it seems like
[57:34] everyone's using either cursor clog
[57:36] code. I would have expected more of, you
[57:39] know, totally a synchronous agent, like
[57:41] something that people would just run
[57:44] from a PR. Okay, you can run code from a
[57:47] PR, but it's less common. Maybe
[57:49] sometimes you use copilot because it's
[57:51] built in.
[57:52] >> Yeah, actually this this one here, cloud
[57:54] code, um may may capture some of that
[57:57] traffic. So that that's probably what
[57:59] you're seeing because people will wire
[58:00] up cloud code in CI
[58:03] >> and do things like that.
[58:04] >> Thanks.
[58:05] >> No problem.
[58:20] I've got a potentially dumb question.
[58:23] >> There's no dumb questions
[58:24] >> this. Well, we'll see.
[58:27] >> Actually, you know, you know,
[58:28] >> you soon.
[58:28] >> I I I had a teacher in grade three that
[58:31] used to tell me, "There are no dumb
[58:33] questions, only dumb people." Go on. I
[58:35] could I could be one of them. Um, how
[58:38] like from from your point of view,
[58:41] right, you've got you you can use like
[58:43] sub agents from like an exploratory
[58:45] standpoint.
[58:45] >> Yeah.
[58:46] >> How how how does like that plus memory
[58:51] plus just like storing snippets of
[58:54] information that might be able I I'm
[58:56] thinking of the like social graph that
[58:57] you just showed, right?
[58:58] >> Yeah.
[58:59] >> Even in an organization that's like
[59:00] several thousand people, you would be
[59:02] able to store that in a very small file.
[59:04] No.
[59:04] >> Um you you would as the graph that you
[59:07] showed.
[59:08] >> Uh oh, I see the social graph component.
[59:11] Yes. Yeah, it can be compact. I'm
[59:13] >> trying to understand how this compares
[59:15] like what's the kind of like USP
[59:17] compared to the exploratory agents and
[59:20] repeating that.
[59:21] >> I I see what you're saying. Okay. Um
[59:24] so there there are two there are two
[59:27] components to that. One is that uh an
[59:30] exploratory agent would have to do this
[59:32] every time. So when it starts from
[59:34] ground zero, yes, it might be possible
[59:36] for it to reconstitute
[59:38] a sort of social graph hierarchy, but it
[59:41] would have to do two things in order to
[59:43] do that. One is it would actually have
[59:45] to write code in order to constitute the
[59:48] the graph, at least the way that agents
[59:50] are today or the way that the models are
[59:52] today. You wouldn't be able to just have
[59:54] it like run basic tools around um the
[59:58] the organization and figure out the
[1:00:00] who's who. um it would have to write
[1:00:03] kind of like what that social graph
[1:00:05] algorithm is, run it and then get the
[1:00:08] distillation out the back end. So um at
[1:00:11] that point you're basically getting
[1:00:13] close to that component. Anyways, so
[1:00:15] that you short circuit it and just run
[1:00:18] it and use it. Um maybe I should explain
[1:00:20] some of the motivation for that thing.
[1:00:22] Actually I I realized now that I may not
[1:00:25] have done that effectively. Um, social
[1:00:27] graph is not just about conveying
[1:00:31] information about who the experts are.
[1:00:33] It's used within the context engine as a
[1:00:36] pivot point um into more like important
[1:00:39] context. So understanding who the
[1:00:42] experts are in a particular code area
[1:00:45] acts as a jump point because um another
[1:00:49] part of a context engine which happens
[1:00:51] at the ingestion and processing layer is
[1:00:55] um distilling the um we call it bottling
[1:00:58] the expert but it's essentially
[1:01:00] distilling what that individual has
[1:01:02] worked on in the past. uh where they sit
[1:01:05] in the in the kind of hierarchy of the
[1:01:07] organization um the the decisions that
[1:01:10] they've made based on Slack
[1:01:11] conversations that they've had based on
[1:01:13] their PR comments all this kind of stuff
[1:01:15] um when you distill that down it's and
[1:01:18] you pass it to the agent then what
[1:01:20] happens is like let's say that I'm a new
[1:01:23] employee and I'm coming to work on a
[1:01:25] particular area of code um there are a
[1:01:28] bunch of different ways of loading
[1:01:29] context for that code one is you know
[1:01:32] semantic search via vector vector
[1:01:34] search. Right? So that's kind of layer
[1:01:36] one. Another layer is uh pre-built
[1:01:40] memories. And then the the third layer
[1:01:42] is bottling unbottling the expert for
[1:01:46] that area of code. And getting that
[1:01:49] expert's learnings into context is is a
[1:01:52] really powerful mechanism. It helps
[1:01:53] drive the rest of the retrieval in an
[1:01:56] agentic loop and it helps um the agent
[1:02:00] uh directionally like where to go next.
[1:02:02] Does that make sense?
[1:02:03] >> Right. I think everybody's in now.
[1:02:05] >> Awesome.
[1:02:06] >> So, let's uh
[1:02:07] >> Okay. So, I think we're if we're all in
[1:02:10] then
[1:02:12] uh the next thing here is
[1:02:16] once I get this back up on the screen.
[1:02:18] >> I'm still I'm still sending invites. I
[1:02:20] saw someone just So, please keep coming
[1:02:22] and we can keep going.
[1:02:24] >> Yep. So, um, feel free to basically just
[1:02:29] fire this repo at your agent and get it
[1:02:32] to like run it. If you if you literally
[1:02:34] just say to Cloud Code, run this against
[1:02:37] my repo, um, be sure to give it a time
[1:02:40] range or a PR limit, otherwise it'll go
[1:02:43] off the rails and take a really long
[1:02:45] time to finish. So just say like process
[1:02:48] the last like 300 PRs or process up till
[1:02:52] you know September 2025 or something
[1:02:55] like that. Um there's enough information
[1:02:58] in the readme that it should be able to
[1:03:00] just do it and just run it against your
[1:03:02] repo.
[1:03:06] >> I get cloned said read the read me and
[1:03:09] make it happen.
[1:03:11] >> Yeah.
[1:03:13] >> Can I ask another what's your
[1:03:17] What's your plans for the coming year or
[1:03:20] something
[1:03:20] >> for for unblocked
[1:03:26] >> is it is it about unblocked or or about
[1:03:28] this this sort of side project
[1:03:32] >> this
[1:03:36] >> um so I mean I've I've sort of alluded
[1:03:39] to this before but like where the puck
[1:03:42] is going is with fully autonomous agents
[1:03:45] So we're very focused on making sure
[1:03:47] that autonomous agent flows are highly
[1:03:51] optimized. You, as I was saying at the
[1:03:53] beginning of the conversation, you
[1:03:55] cannot run those things effectively
[1:03:58] without like um very finely tuned
[1:04:01] context.
[1:04:03] >> Yeah. So when you think about it
[1:04:10] at some point
[1:04:16] I read things like tracing what what do
[1:04:19] agents and you get run books out of
[1:04:20] those is that is that the path you're
[1:04:23] you're investing in or what what is it
[1:04:26] retrieval what what
[1:04:28] >> are you talking specifically about
[1:04:29] incident management then or
[1:04:31] >> sorry
[1:04:32] >> are you are you speaking specifically
[1:04:33] about incident management management,
[1:04:34] that sort of thing.
[1:04:35] >> No, I'm I'm speaking about your I'm
[1:04:38] thinking actually more from a business
[1:04:39] perspective. How can we extract business
[1:04:41] knowledge that's really deeply embedded
[1:04:44] into systems nobody knows anymore and
[1:04:46] some people know think they know but
[1:04:47] they don't know.
[1:04:48] >> Yeah.
[1:04:49] >> Uh and documents, human knowledge,
[1:04:52] right? Tested knowledge.
[1:04:53] >> Yep. So, I mean there's there's two ways
[1:04:56] of servicing that either at the product
[1:04:58] level or um through the context engine
[1:05:01] itself. And increasingly what we see is
[1:05:04] that people leverage uh agents to do
[1:05:07] their work even at that level. So
[1:05:08] they'll they'll go to cloud code,
[1:05:10] they'll connect the unblock context
[1:05:12] engine, it'll be like do this thing for
[1:05:14] me and then the context engine will find
[1:05:16] all the things that it needs to do that
[1:05:18] task and it it'll surface that data.
[1:05:20] >> Yeah.
[1:05:23] >> For us that means the first near-term
[1:05:25] road map is API.
[1:05:26] >> Yes. It's like CLI
[1:05:28] >> CLI API
[1:05:32] question
[1:05:48] or it's just good that
[1:05:58] Cool. I'm going to lift this off again.
[1:06:00] Hopefully people start submitting some
[1:06:02] PRs and we can
[1:06:03] >> Yeah,
[1:06:10] you're in that GitHub. Let me actually
[1:06:12] repost it in the Slack channel
[1:06:15] because that link will
[1:06:18] >> so this this org will stay up until the
[1:06:20] end of the week. Um at which point we'll
[1:06:22] basically bring it down and um release
[1:06:26] this uh as open source and uh everyone
[1:06:29] that contributes obviously is going to
[1:06:31] get credited. So um you your name will
[1:06:34] be on it.
[1:06:38] Should
[1:06:49] we like
[1:06:51] set up the repo locally and then start
[1:06:53] doing what's basically? So I just
[1:06:57] finished setting up
[1:06:57] >> Yeah, just just clone the repo. Um you
[1:07:00] the easiest thing to do is to take uh an
[1:07:03] agent like Claude and point it at um
[1:07:05] just launch it from that repo from that
[1:07:07] directory and just say please uh
[1:07:10] bootstrap and launch this this product
[1:07:13] and away it will go.
[1:07:16] If if you guys run into any kind of
[1:07:17] technical things, we'll we're here
[1:07:19] obviously. Yeah.
[1:07:25] >> Let's hold on. Let's get you the the
[1:07:27] mic. Oh, you got it. I've got a I've got
[1:07:28] a lapel now. So
[1:07:29] >> awesome. Cool.
[1:07:32] >> Yeah.
[1:07:32] >> Can you hear me? Yeah. Perfect. Um, so
[1:07:34] on the on the slide where you had like
[1:07:37] the performance and you guys were like
[1:07:39] 80% and without unblocked it was 20%.
[1:07:42] >> Yeah.
[1:07:43] >> Um, and now I see that well you are
[1:07:45] basically hooking up like unblocked to
[1:07:48] cloud cut. So in a way is it a fair
[1:07:51] comparison to say
[1:07:53] I will use vanilla cloud code with
[1:07:56] access to the MCP and to the skills.
[1:07:59] >> Yeah.
[1:07:59] >> And then I will use clo codes hooked
[1:08:02] with unblocked with the same MCPS and
[1:08:05] the same skills.
[1:08:06] >> Yeah.
[1:08:06] >> And here you can do the performance
[1:08:08] comparison. And here you still have a
[1:08:10] lot of alpha from I I guess whatever you
[1:08:14] are cooking inside unblocked. Is was it
[1:08:16] the comparison that was done or was it
[1:08:19] done without
[1:08:20] >> was it done with a vanilla cloud code
[1:08:22] but without context?
[1:08:23] >> No, it was done with MCP servers like
[1:08:25] GitHub and Slack wired up.
[1:08:26] >> I see.
[1:08:27] >> Yeah, cool.
[1:08:27] >> We we basically got parody with all the
[1:08:30] MCP servers of every SAS vendor in one.
[1:08:33] It was like vanilla clawed all MCPS and
[1:08:35] the other one was clawed with unblocked
[1:08:37] only
[1:08:39] >> and then do the task and
[1:08:40] >> same context like the same context file
[1:08:43] >> same same prompt
[1:08:44] >> and same access. Yeah. Yeah.
[1:08:47] >> It's it's pretty fun. Yeah. Oh, thank
[1:08:48] you.
[1:08:50] >> Um maybe two questions. So, one is uh I
[1:08:54] see that like a lot of these like social
[1:08:56] graphs are built with like the
[1:08:57] traditional network uh kind of
[1:08:59] calculation and statistical aspects of
[1:09:02] networks. Um, is this like the approach
[1:09:05] that you began with and it already
[1:09:07] worked the best or uh did you like
[1:09:10] because most of memory systems you work
[1:09:11] more on like filtering out like episodic
[1:09:13] memory something else something else
[1:09:15] something else and this is like really
[1:09:16] scoring really nice scoring system
[1:09:19] >> uh that's first question is it like also
[1:09:21] with the unblocked second question
[1:09:24] >> um you mentioned that it works with
[1:09:25] teams uh Microsoft environment I wonder
[1:09:29] what the differences did you observe
[1:09:31] between building social graphs for
[1:09:33] different environments because on GitHub
[1:09:34] I imagine it's very different than on
[1:09:37] SharePoint teams etc etc is it also like
[1:09:40] these network stats based or is it
[1:09:42] something different
[1:09:44] >> um so I mean our first implementation
[1:09:47] was was incredibly naive right it was
[1:09:50] just using uh the numbers of PR
[1:09:52] contributions and comparing that
[1:09:54] directly with uh the number of PRs
[1:09:57] reviewed by each person so just a simple
[1:10:00] like numbers game um with that that
[1:10:03] didn't produce accurate team clusters.
[1:10:06] So then we we got on to um the
[1:10:09] algorithms that you see here. Um Unblock
[1:10:11] does a little bit more than than this.
[1:10:13] So this is kind of like a middle road.
[1:10:15] Um another strategy that Unblock uses is
[1:10:19] um like experts by by vector clusters.
[1:10:23] So when we ingest the source code and
[1:10:25] vectorize it um we understand like who
[1:10:28] the the most contributors are for that
[1:10:30] piece of source code. So when we look up
[1:10:33] individuals, we can see what they've
[1:10:35] been working on and what the um the
[1:10:37] clusters in proximity are and then
[1:10:39] relate people based on their their
[1:10:41] cluster proximity. So that's more of
[1:10:42] like an ML type approach. And then
[1:10:45] there's a final layer which is um uh an
[1:10:49] sort of AI LLM heavy layer that does
[1:10:52] distillations of uh a whole bunch of
[1:10:56] different context elements, things that
[1:10:58] people have worked on in the past,
[1:11:00] conversations that they've been having
[1:11:01] in Slack. Um and then when when you take
[1:11:04] all that and you weigh it against uh the
[1:11:07] like procedurally generated graph, you
[1:11:09] get a much more accurate distillation
[1:11:12] there. This one here, you'll notice like
[1:11:14] some some people will get pulled into
[1:11:16] team clusters that you know are you know
[1:11:20] operating across many different teams
[1:11:22] for example and this won't account for
[1:11:24] that
[1:11:28] >> difference
[1:11:38] algorithms different let's say that you
[1:11:42] I don't want to take out
[1:11:44] >> this so no this algorithm is like purely
[1:11:47] SEM based. So the algorithms for you're
[1:11:49] you're right like um Slack teams they're
[1:11:53] quite a bit different because you don't
[1:11:54] have these review points.
[1:11:56] >> So then it becomes you know who's the
[1:11:58] most active in particular channels and
[1:12:01] then you need a distillation or a
[1:12:03] summary of what that channel is about
[1:12:05] and you need to vectorize that and then
[1:12:07] you need to score it against the the
[1:12:09] most frequent contributors. Um, but it's
[1:12:12] not enough. You have to relate that back
[1:12:14] to the SCM data in order to figure out
[1:12:17] who the real experts are. One one of the
[1:12:19] problems that I I've personally
[1:12:21] experienced in some organizations I've
[1:12:22] worked at is that you get like the noisy
[1:12:25] junior engineer, right? So, they're
[1:12:27] they're very noisy. They love to talk,
[1:12:29] but the signal to noise ratio is not
[1:12:31] great. And uh just because someone's not
[1:12:34] saying a lot of things doesn't mean that
[1:12:36] their messages are not impactful.
[1:12:39] So part of this game is about assessing
[1:12:41] the impact of uh when people say certain
[1:12:45] things, you know, how does that relate
[1:12:47] to the PRs that get spawned off as a
[1:12:50] consequence? How many of those PRs get
[1:12:52] merged? You know, that sort of thing.
[1:12:54] >> Yeah.
[1:13:06] >> Oh, is there not?
[1:13:07] >> There should be. Okay, check that.
[1:13:09] >> Well, you should be able to open a pull
[1:13:11] request. You can't push to main.
[1:13:12] >> Okay.
[1:13:13] >> So, if that if that's the situ we But I
[1:13:15] mean, we'll check.
[1:13:16] >> Yeah, you should you should be able to
[1:13:17] create a branch.
[1:13:18] >> Oh, uh, no. No. Can he can't fork the
[1:13:21] repo either.
[1:13:22] >> Oh. Um, yeah, forks might be disabled.
[1:13:26] >> This will be open source like at the end
[1:13:27] of the week. Um, and your all your
[1:13:29] contributions will be on it.
[1:13:39] What's really fun is using that social
[1:13:41] graph tool later against your own repo
[1:13:42] and like showing your team.
[1:13:44] >> Yeah.
[1:13:46] >> Oh, sorry.
[1:13:48] >> Oh, I'll
[1:13:55] come.
[1:14:12] I like that. Unblock tried to answer you
[1:14:14] for that question.
[1:14:21] >> Oh,
[1:14:27] you see that the Slack auto response?
[1:14:33] Sorry.
[1:14:35] Are you in here?
[1:14:38] That's a camera. Sorry.
[1:14:42] >> Oh, it's okay. I was just
[1:15:16] Oh, okay. Um, let me check to see. That
[1:15:19] should not be the case.
[1:15:29] Okay.
[1:15:31] Let me know if you still need a GitHub
[1:15:33] invite.
[1:15:35] >> Just check the members. I think there
[1:15:37] might Yeah, there might be an issue
[1:15:38] here. Just a second.
[1:16:02] Oh, these were direct assignments. So, I
[1:16:05] think we have to like pull people into
[1:16:07] the whole project because they're not
[1:16:10] they're not org assigned.
[1:16:12] >> Oh, GitHub, I love you.
[1:16:17] >> 09s of uptime.
[1:16:19] >> Yeah, we'll fix this one here. Yeah,
[1:16:22] slam everybody in.
[1:16:44] Come on.
[1:16:45] >> You got it up. I'm trying to because now
[1:16:49] we just need to add people.
[1:16:50] >> Go to settings collaborators.
[1:17:23] unblocked. You all have right access. It
[1:17:26] is the name of the company.
[1:17:26] >> Just just validate that for us if you
[1:17:28] would.
[1:17:29] >> Yeah, please let me know.
[1:17:44] >> Perfect.
[1:17:47] >> All right.
[1:17:59] All right, we're getting real PRs now.
[1:18:02] There we go. Nice. Nice.
[1:18:11] >> Hell yeah.
[1:18:21] Now let's do fun things.
[1:18:45] Okay, nice. Looks good to me.
[1:18:50] >> What?
[1:18:55] >> I think we we have our our first
[1:18:57] approved PR.
[1:19:09] I'm send I'm just sending ridiculous
[1:19:11] chats to unblocked so you can see it try
[1:19:13] to answer questions in Slack as as PRs
[1:19:16] come up.
[1:19:19] I'm going to see what it says about
[1:19:21] this.
[1:19:22] >> Ask it to
[1:19:23] >> It's like Oh, let me think about it.
[1:19:24] >> Oh, did you ask it about the PR?
[1:19:26] >> Yeah, but the PR I think you accepted.
[1:19:27] So, we'll see what happens.
[1:19:28] >> Yeah, I mean it did it did approve it.
[1:19:30] So, you know, unblocked was
[1:19:32] >> unblocked like this looks good to me,
[1:19:33] man. blocked was down.
[1:19:37] >> Only visible to you. Oh no.
[1:19:42] >> What was such a good answer though?
[1:19:47] >> Nice PR. Good job on block. Great
[1:19:50] answer.
[1:20:01] >> Yep. Oh,
[1:20:05] yeah. Yeah. I'll put it back up. I'll
[1:20:06] put it back up. One sec.
[1:20:09] >> Uh, where did it go? Actually, I lost
[1:20:11] the
[1:20:33] over here.
[1:20:35] >> Oh, yeah.
[1:20:48] handle the sources or maybe something.
[1:20:52] >> Do you want the app?
[1:20:53] >> Yeah, for sure. Yeah.
[1:20:55] >> Oh, yeah. Yeah.
[1:20:56] >> Yeah. Of course. We were focused on you
[1:20:59] building, but Yeah.
[1:21:01] >> What am I supposed to do?
[1:21:02] >> Oh, no. It's okay. I mean, let's go.
[1:21:04] >> Oh. Oh,
[1:21:06] >> I sorry. So this this uh this thing that
[1:21:09] I showed before it it is the project
[1:21:11] that exists in that repo.
[1:21:14] >> So the
[1:21:15] >> oh so the idea is like um think think
[1:21:18] about features that you want to add or
[1:21:20] things that you want to to fix or like
[1:21:22] new components and then just hack away
[1:21:26] at it and submit a PR.
[1:21:28] >> Sorry.
[1:21:29] >> Yeah, my bad.
[1:21:30] >> Um do you want to open up like a
[1:21:33] terminal session and show the MCP?
[1:21:35] >> Oh, sure. Yeah, because I'm like people
[1:21:37] can obviously use it but they don't have
[1:21:38] all our source. Yeah.
[1:21:42] >> Consultant
[1:21:45] wanted to try to propose it to a client.
[1:21:47] I cannot show the
[1:21:50] context or maybe get an ide.
[1:22:03] Well, I mean like one thing that you
[1:22:05] could do um if you're visiting clients
[1:22:09] is u you can ask them if they run the
[1:22:11] tool on their
[1:22:13] >> uh on their um repo and then it will
[1:22:15] generate this result for them so they
[1:22:18] can see on their own project what the
[1:22:20] value is. Right.
[1:22:21] >> I think Peter I think he's just asking
[1:22:23] about our product specifically not this.
[1:22:25] >> Oh unblocks. You're asking about
[1:22:26] unblocked.
[1:22:27] >> My bad man.
[1:22:30] >> We're driving this way.
[1:22:31] >> Sorry. Sorry, single track mind. Um,
[1:22:34] okay. So your your question is how can
[1:22:37] you demonstrate the value of unblock to
[1:22:40] customers or
[1:22:40] >> see the value?
[1:22:54] Yeah,
[1:22:59] >> sorry.
[1:22:59] >> Yeah,
[1:23:00] >> you can make conflicts emerge in in your
[1:23:02] app, but um and then there is the
[1:23:06] compliance layer which is very
[1:23:07] interesting for corporate clients.
[1:23:09] >> I was thinking how this um is translated
[1:23:13] to a UX because you know
[1:23:16] >> many people are known I understand it's
[1:23:19] mainly for coding. Yeah.
[1:23:21] >> And whether this is for technical people
[1:23:24] or maybe you know people overseeing some
[1:23:28] engineers or the engineer itself I mean
[1:23:30] just see how your platform works. But if
[1:23:33] it is is out of context I mean I it's
[1:23:36] it's okay. I
[1:23:37] >> no no that's that's totally fine. So
[1:23:39] this this dashboard is kind of like the
[1:23:43] um the sort of front-end customer
[1:23:45] interface to the product. So you know
[1:23:48] you come in here and you can ask any
[1:23:50] question about your codebase or your or
[1:23:53] your organization and get an answer for
[1:23:55] it here. Um this is right now you know
[1:23:59] attached to sorry I lost my cursor. This
[1:24:02] is attached to um this test or that we
[1:24:05] have but I could use it against
[1:24:06] unblocked and I could say like you know
[1:24:10] um I have a little hot thing here that I
[1:24:12] can show.
[1:24:16] Oops.
[1:24:19] >> So, the source mark engine is an
[1:24:21] internal component that we use to track
[1:24:23] source code changes through time,
[1:24:25] including like where
[1:24:27] um you know, changes move between files
[1:24:29] and so on. Um, so as a demonstration,
[1:24:33] you know, you can show off, I mean, you
[1:24:36] can book your your customers into a demo
[1:24:38] with us and we can demonstrate this or
[1:24:40] you can wire it up to your own
[1:24:41] organization and demonstrate this flow
[1:24:44] to customers um, and try to find, you
[1:24:47] know, use cases where data sources
[1:24:49] conflict and demonstrate that that the
[1:24:52] challenge with context engines is that
[1:24:54] it's really hard to demonstrate the
[1:24:56] value to someone without actually wiring
[1:24:58] it up. So there there is a little bit of
[1:25:00] overhead there where people have to
[1:25:03] connect it to all their integrations.
[1:25:04] Now the good thing is um unblocked has a
[1:25:08] free enterprise trial period so people
[1:25:10] can try out the product in its fullest
[1:25:12] form before um uh paying for it. Yeah.
[1:25:18] >> So if some of that information is
[1:25:19] incorrect, you can just reply in the
[1:25:22] chatbot or flag it in the references.
[1:25:24] >> Exactly. Yeah.
[1:25:29] So you can just you can reply here or
[1:25:31] you can say not helpful and explain why
[1:25:34] and then uh it will distill it for the
[1:25:36] next the next round.
[1:25:38] >> So it will adjust some weights or
[1:25:40] confidence scores internally.
[1:25:42] >> Uh well internally what it does is it
[1:25:44] constructs task memory.
[1:25:46] >> So um it looks for those kind of
[1:25:49] repeated signals and uh it this is
[1:25:52] actually where the experts graph comes
[1:25:53] in. It's used a lot. Um the experts
[1:25:56] graph provides like weight. So when an
[1:26:00] expert comes in and says that's not
[1:26:01] correct, it's going to get some some
[1:26:03] more weight and distill a memory for it.
[1:26:06] Um if uh if it's just a new engineer
[1:26:10] that says that's not right, then that's
[1:26:11] not really a trustworthy source yet. So
[1:26:14] uh you have to have a trustworthy source
[1:26:18] to to base that on. Does that make
[1:26:19] sense?
[1:26:20] >> Yeah, it makes a lot of sense. It's like
[1:26:22] social network.
[1:26:23] >> Exactly. somehow.
[1:26:24] >> Yeah. Yeah.
[1:26:25] >> Thanks.
[1:26:26] >> No problem.
[1:26:33] >> Cool.
[1:26:42] >> Oh, under the hood. Um, well, when it's
[1:26:46] presented to the AI, it's presented as
[1:26:48] as files. Um but under the hood we store
[1:26:51] it in you know database tables and
[1:26:53] stuff. Um like the memories are are are
[1:26:56] constituted from a bunch of different
[1:26:58] sources. So they're not just like flat
[1:27:00] file based you know they'll be the whole
[1:27:03] memory construct will be hydrated at
[1:27:05] runtime. So
[1:27:07] >> will you just give your tools to your
[1:27:10] database based on whatever criteria
[1:27:13] users?
[1:27:14] >> Yeah. Well for Yeah. So yes, um there
[1:27:16] are a bunch of tools for data retrieval.
[1:27:18] For memory specifically, um you can't
[1:27:22] really leave it up to the agent to do
[1:27:24] memory hydration because that's kind of
[1:27:27] like part of the seed context. In order
[1:27:29] to get the agent to go in the right
[1:27:31] direction, you have to seed it with the
[1:27:34] appropriate data and experts context is
[1:27:37] a good jump off point for the agent. So
[1:27:40] yeah.
[1:27:43] Yep.
[1:27:46] Uh is there any official benchmark that
[1:27:49] kind of track the type of value you try
[1:27:51] to bring like um yeah because I feel
[1:27:53] like it's not exactly coding or it is
[1:27:56] but yeah I'm curious if there's any uh
[1:27:58] public things that you're tracking
[1:28:00] yourself against.
[1:28:01] >> So we we we do have some internal
[1:28:02] benchmarks. Um you're right it's a
[1:28:04] little bit squishy.
[1:28:05] >> Um so anthro have you have you heard
[1:28:08] Boris Churnney talk um at cloud code?
[1:28:11] It's like the creator of cloud code.
[1:28:13] >> The creator of cloud code. Yeah. So he
[1:28:16] um did this interview where they were
[1:28:18] talking about like how they measure
[1:28:20] success uh for cloud code internally.
[1:28:23] This may have changed because there's a
[1:28:25] lot of benchmarks now that they have
[1:28:27] like they they have like the the
[1:28:28] talk benchmark. You guys have probably
[1:28:30] seen that one. Um but it but what that
[1:28:32] really distills down to is vibes. And so
[1:28:35] the most important thing in uh systems
[1:28:38] like this is to capture sentiment. And
[1:28:40] so if your sentiment is uh is trending
[1:28:43] upwards then um that's a good thing. Our
[1:28:46] our sentiment right now is uh on a scale
[1:28:49] of minus 100 to 100 somewhere around 60
[1:28:54] uh 60 score. So on a normalized scale
[1:28:56] that's like 0.75
[1:28:59] to 0.8. So, so the vibe would be
[1:29:01] captured by something like maybe less
[1:29:04] back and forth on the PRs or maybe um I
[1:29:06] don't know you having less back and
[1:29:08] forth with clothes to get your stuff
[1:29:10] done.
[1:29:12] >> Yeah. So the the vibes are like they're
[1:29:16] they're people satisfied, right? So
[1:29:18] satisfaction can come from a lot of
[1:29:20] different sources and dissatisfaction
[1:29:22] can come from a lot of different
[1:29:23] sources. So the way to think about that
[1:29:25] is that it encodes all of those things.
[1:29:28] Um, but you can capture specific metrics
[1:29:30] and we do how long things take and we're
[1:29:33] actually currently working really hard
[1:29:35] to bring the uh response times down
[1:29:38] because um
[1:29:41] uh you know even though agents are um
[1:29:44] here's the interesting thing as we move
[1:29:46] towards a more autonomous universe
[1:29:49] response times for MCP servers are
[1:29:51] actually less and less important. The
[1:29:54] more important thing is that they get
[1:29:56] the answer absolutely bang on.
[1:29:58] >> Yeah.
[1:29:58] >> And the reason is because um the the
[1:30:01] amount of time that a context engine
[1:30:03] spends collecting all that information
[1:30:05] and distilling it is a microcosm of what
[1:30:08] the full task takes to implement and to
[1:30:12] and to traverse. So if you can spend a
[1:30:15] little bit more time and cut the
[1:30:17] implementation down by like 60 70 80%
[1:30:20] that's a huge win, right? And go ahead.
[1:30:25] >> Sorry, very small followup. Actually,
[1:30:27] I'm curious. Do you have any uh rough uh
[1:30:30] numbers on how much time does it spend
[1:30:33] retrieving context versus executing the
[1:30:35] task to your point? Like is it 10% right
[1:30:38] now, 90%, or is it I have no idea. I
[1:30:41] mean, I have my own experience.
[1:30:42] >> It's like yeah um agent context
[1:30:46] collection is probably close to that
[1:30:49] number. It's like 90%. Um the actual
[1:30:51] code writing part is really really fast.
[1:30:54] If if you can even just watch what an
[1:30:56] agent is doing. Um when it writes the
[1:30:59] code that output tokens are by the way
[1:31:01] the the thing that drags down um the the
[1:31:05] performance. Everyone used to think it
[1:31:07] was input tokens. We've run tons of
[1:31:09] experiments with this. You can bring the
[1:31:10] input token size up and you know time to
[1:31:14] first output token now is is pretty
[1:31:16] pretty good. Like it's pretty highly
[1:31:17] optimized. The thing that really impacts
[1:31:19] performance is output tokens. So um you
[1:31:23] have to be like judicious with the way
[1:31:25] that you collect and supply context back
[1:31:28] to the agent uh so that it remains tight
[1:31:32] on its output loops as well.
[1:31:35] >> For um for one benchmark that Peter
[1:31:37] mentioned in the talk we we gave an
[1:31:39] ambitious task because obviously it's
[1:31:41] prompt dependent how much time you're
[1:31:42] adding and like with a context engine.
[1:31:44] Um but the ambitious task we gave was to
[1:31:46] implement the new adaptive thinking mode
[1:31:48] in anthropics tool chain when they
[1:31:51] introduced that which as mentioned it
[1:31:53] went from a 25m minute wall clock time
[1:31:56] to with with unblock with a context
[1:31:58] engine. The other case without was 2 and
[1:32:00] a half hours. It was 2 hours and 25
[1:32:02] minutes. But the main reason for that
[1:32:04] was we gave it all the data. We ran the
[1:32:06] prompt and then its first output was
[1:32:08] like totally wrong. So you had to the
[1:32:11] human had to loop again and be like no
[1:32:13] no no this this this and the next output
[1:32:15] was wrong and the next output. So once
[1:32:17] you do four loops you have like a two
[1:32:18] and a half hour wall clock time versus
[1:32:20] obviously the 25minut when it did not
[1:32:22] meet that when there's no corrections
[1:32:24] required.
[1:32:25] >> Um so as mentioned it's think of it as a
[1:32:27] waterfall. The more high quality correct
[1:32:30] like high signal context you have up
[1:32:32] front the better every single thing the
[1:32:34] agent's going to do until it says it's
[1:32:37] done whether it got it right or not.
[1:32:39] Yeah.
[1:32:42] >> Yeah.
[1:32:44] >> It's got it.
[1:32:47] >> You also mentioned that uh the token
[1:32:50] usage on tool calls and like just
[1:32:53] information search really decreased. So
[1:32:56] I know that a lot of these tools that
[1:32:58] provide uh or aggregators for tool use
[1:33:01] they have insane like uh token usage. So
[1:33:04] maybe have like some estimations on how
[1:33:07] like let's say I need a slack
[1:33:09] conversation some summary from one
[1:33:12] conversation to another or like how
[1:33:13] people interact there would be like 60k
[1:33:17] tokens on composio I wonder how many
[1:33:20] tokens it would be like using unblocked
[1:33:23] >> yeah
[1:33:25] lower we're still very vibes there like
[1:33:27] it's hard to get real data from other
[1:33:30] customer or people in the market um But
[1:33:33] the again with that same I'm going to
[1:33:35] keep talking to the same task as easy.
[1:33:36] That one went from 21 million token
[1:33:39] total usage to 10 million token with the
[1:33:42] context engine. So a part of that though
[1:33:44] is because you didn't have to doom loop.
[1:33:47] >> So when when the of course like that
[1:33:49] increased a lot of the tokens expense
[1:33:50] like so we did drop it by 50% on a large
[1:33:53] task. Again obviously if you're like yo
[1:33:55] center a div you're not going to get a
[1:33:57] lot of gain. It's like probably in the
[1:33:58] training data. Um, but yeah, like any
[1:34:02] feature uh fix like so a lot of like
[1:34:04] again a lot of what people are putting
[1:34:05] through unblocked are what an engineer
[1:34:07] is doing every day. It's very rare that
[1:34:08] you're doing a task that's like so I
[1:34:11] don't know minor that like I mean then
[1:34:13] again I've asked I've asked Claude to do
[1:34:14] git push so I'm not the only one I bet I
[1:34:18] was like you do it. It's like why did
[1:34:19] that cost me 30 cents?
[1:34:22] I don't know.
[1:34:23] >> Yeah, I put I did all the effort to put
[1:34:26] my GBG keys in the right place so I'm
[1:34:27] like cloud
[1:34:29] Go.
[1:34:33] Any more questions while you all ship?
[1:34:35] Any confusion? Anything I can unblock
[1:34:38] for you? It's my purpose in life.
[1:34:41] >> Sorry, you may have answered this
[1:34:42] question already, but um so you're are
[1:34:45] you using knowledge b knowledgebased rag
[1:34:48] on in unblocked or what exactly is the
[1:34:50] tech that you are surfacing?
[1:34:52] >> Oh, so many things. Uh I can come talk
[1:34:56] to you at the side. I'll take my mic
[1:34:58] off. I'm just gonna answer that
[1:34:59] question.
[1:34:59] >> Sure.
[1:35:00] >> That was just
[1:35:00] >> this
[1:35:07] talented
[1:35:24] Yeah.
[1:35:46] >> Oh, it's it's real time basically. So,
[1:35:49] um there I guess there's there's two
[1:35:52] parts to that question. one is like how
[1:35:54] much or how frequently unblocked updates
[1:35:57] the data on the back end. Um so it's
[1:36:00] it's real time for many of the
[1:36:02] integrations and then on a a cron job
[1:36:04] for others because for those for those
[1:36:06] particular integrations they don't have
[1:36:08] web hooks basically.
[1:36:10] >> Yeah. But the the dis so that means that
[1:36:13] rebuilding the graph data has to happen
[1:36:16] on a on a very frequent basis.
[1:36:23] Yeah.
[1:36:43] >> Yeah.
[1:36:47] >> No, it's it's incremental.
[1:36:50] So our our like you know social graph
[1:36:53] builder algorithm has an incremental
[1:36:55] component to it. So we don't have to
[1:36:56] rerun the whole thing. Um but also uh
[1:36:59] social graphs are less sensitive to
[1:37:03] frequent changes in data because it's
[1:37:06] unlikely that you know a single change
[1:37:10] is going to make a huge impact on the
[1:37:12] experts graph unless your organization
[1:37:14] is brand new. So for
[1:37:21] Yeah.
[1:37:25] >> Yes. Yeah. So, as an example, um we do
[1:37:29] best practices distillation on a much
[1:37:32] lower cadence like basically uh week by
[1:37:35] week because uh yeah, it just doesn't
[1:37:38] change that much.
[1:37:41] >> Yeah.
[1:38:01] Um, well, the Oh, yeah.
[1:38:04] Repeat your question. That's a good
[1:38:06] question. So, I want to make sure we get
[1:38:07] that one down.
[1:38:10] Oh,
[1:38:12] >> in in terms of customer privacy, data
[1:38:15] retention
[1:38:16] um kind of
[1:38:17] >> yeah from from my point of view I'm
[1:38:19] thinking of like enterprise SAS or even
[1:38:21] like on premise type deployments which
[1:38:23] I'm I'm not suggesting that you I'm just
[1:38:25] thinking of that customer kind of
[1:38:27] modality.
[1:38:28] >> Um
[1:38:29] >> yeah, do you get do you get push back?
[1:38:31] Do you how do they feel about you
[1:38:32] holding data? It's another processor in
[1:38:34] the loop.
[1:38:36] Um well so the the the privacy
[1:38:39] discussions happen at the organizational
[1:38:41] level. So it um uh we don't actually run
[1:38:46] into a lot of friction. Um there are
[1:38:48] definitely environments like in
[1:38:50] government and at banks that have uh
[1:38:53] super sensitive needs and so for those
[1:38:55] needs we have an on-prem solution but
[1:38:58] it's definitely not the path that I
[1:39:00] would recommend like staying cloud-based
[1:39:03] like we we have very large enterprise
[1:39:06] organizations
[1:39:07] uh that are entirely cloud-based, like
[1:39:10] fully cloud-based. Um the you know the
[1:39:14] the secret sauce is kind of like less
[1:39:17] encoded in source code now and more
[1:39:19] encoded in um uh the reasoning. So,
[1:39:24] organizations tend to be a little bit
[1:39:25] more sensitive around things like Slack
[1:39:27] data for instance, but uh the way that
[1:39:30] we store uh data like we have a whole
[1:39:33] white paper about how we protect
[1:39:35] customer data um and it's never been a
[1:39:38] problem.
[1:39:40] >> Yeah.
[1:39:44] >> Pardon me. Can you run on prem?
[1:39:46] >> Yes, we we do have an on-prem solution,
[1:39:48] but as I say, like it's it's not the
[1:39:51] recommended approach, but for sensitive
[1:39:54] environments, for sure. Yeah.
[1:39:58] >> Oh, why it's not recommended? Um, well,
[1:40:01] the cloud-based integrations um,
[1:40:05] you know, get updated more frequently
[1:40:07] and so there's software patches. It's a
[1:40:10] little bit harder to maintain within an
[1:40:11] organization. Uh there's there's one
[1:40:13] customer it's a bank um where
[1:40:17] administering
[1:40:18] uh the platform becomes quite difficult
[1:40:21] because they have network isolation and
[1:40:23] so like now one of us has to you know
[1:40:27] sit within that network and administer
[1:40:29] the platform or we have to train uh
[1:40:32] individuals within the company to
[1:40:34] administer the platform. So it's just
[1:40:36] it's more of a a maintenance and um
[1:40:38] handholding exercise.
[1:40:41] But yeah.
[1:40:48] >> Yeah, exactly. That's exactly right.
[1:41:02] >> Yeah. Thank you. Thanks for coming.
[1:41:08] very much.
