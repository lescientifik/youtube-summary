## Transcription

[0:14] Welcome. So, this workshop is on Ralph
[0:20] loops. Uh, hands up here who knows what
[0:22] a Ralph loop is. That's almost everyone.
[0:25] I'm guessing that the other folks who
[0:27] came in were just here because they
[0:28] thought that sounded weird or or maybe
[0:31] looking for a quiet place to work. I
[0:32] don't know, but you're very welcome. So,
[0:35] what we're going to do today, this is a
[0:36] two-hour workshop. We're going to uh if
[0:39] you could just kind of um make a little
[0:41] bit of space if you need to as people
[0:42] are coming in, that would be really
[0:43] helpful. Thank you. This is a two-hour
[0:44] workshop. We're actually going to build
[0:45] Ralph Loops together. We're going to do
[0:47] this together on our own laptops in
[0:49] order to uh to make some stuff happen
[0:52] and get some things done. So, so it's
[0:54] not just about theory. This is a very
[0:56] practical thing. So, if you've got a
[0:57] laptop, you're welcome to get it out in
[0:58] a second. We're actually going to try
[1:00] and do this ourselves. Uh, so, uh, I I
[1:03] have a few slides, but not many. Most of
[1:04] this is going to be live demos and kind
[1:06] of interaction, um, points as well. Um,
[1:08] and the idea is at the end of this, you
[1:11] should be able to leave with something
[1:12] that works that we'll uh, we'll apply it
[1:14] to a kind of toy codebase uh, just for
[1:16] fun uh, to create a Pomodoro timer. But
[1:20] uh but hopefully the idea is that you'll
[1:22] be able to use this on your real work
[1:23] when we get uh when we get done. So
[1:26] another show of hands. Okay. Who is
[1:29] using Claude code or codeex specifically
[1:32] to write code? Hands up. Oh, quite a lot
[1:35] of people specifically to write code.
[1:37] Okay. Who is using it to write all their
[1:39] code? Who is no longer writing any code?
[1:43] That's quite a lot of people. Look
[1:44] around for a minute. That that is a huge
[1:46] change. If I'd asked a bunch of
[1:48] programmers six months ago who was not
[1:49] writing any more code, you'd get a very
[1:51] different answer. Uh so next question,
[1:53] who is using either claude code or
[1:55] codeex? Um and I'll include cursor here
[1:57] as well in their non-coding work.
[2:01] Okay, quite a lot of you. What about for
[2:03] all your normal non-coding work?
[2:06] Okay. Interesting. Interesting. So can
[2:09] you just see the future um in the room?
[2:11] Right. There's a few people who are
[2:13] starting but we're still on that journey
[2:15] for sure. And who has built Ralph Loops
[2:17] before? Last show of hands. One or two
[2:20] people. Okay, great. I'm going to be
[2:21] looking to you for all the answers. Um,
[2:23] so that's great. So, uh, just a little
[2:26] bit about me. My name is Chris Parsons.
[2:28] Um, these days I spend most of my time
[2:30] trying to help, uh, teams like the team
[2:32] I used to run figure out what on earth
[2:33] to do with AI mostly. So, uh, I'm a CTO
[2:36] by background. I've done a couple of BC
[2:38] back startups and scaleups and uh this
[2:40] has taken uh me and my friends by storm
[2:43] rather and we are trying to still all
[2:45] figure it out professionally together in
[2:47] terms of how to help our teams adopt and
[2:49] use AI. So that's what I do for a living
[2:51] these days. I have about 30 years or so
[2:53] of building software professionally been
[2:54] the CEO of an agency. I've done a lot of
[2:57] agile consulting remember that uh and
[2:59] that kind of training as well back in
[3:01] the day. And uh and funnily enough all
[3:03] of those it's a whole another talk. all
[3:05] of those uh principles and practices
[3:07] that we taught for years and no one
[3:08] really listened were are still very much
[3:11] applicable um to AI. So, so there we go.
[3:14] Um so these days I'm actually running
[3:17] Ralph loops all the time, 24 hours a day
[3:20] to get my work done. So I'm I'm using
[3:22] them to write my emails. I'm using them
[3:24] to check my calendar. I'm using them to
[3:26] write content and newsletters. I'm using
[3:28] them to help me do my client work. So
[3:30] I'm using them in absolutely everything.
[3:32] I also use them for code which is what
[3:33] we're focusing on today but they are
[3:35] very much applicable to every part of
[3:38] our lives. So by the end of the day the
[3:40] idea is that you will be in the position
[3:42] where you can do that too. Uh so this is
[3:44] how I used to work with AI until quite
[3:46] recently. Uh you probably can't see that
[3:48] very well. This is an N10 workflow uh
[3:51] that I used in order to create my weekly
[3:53] newsletter. It took me uh probably a
[3:56] week to write let alone actually test
[3:58] and debug. Uh, it's got a huge number of
[4:01] different things in here. This this is
[4:02] like a a featured article flow which
[4:04] would read various different articles
[4:06] from my blog and figure out whether I
[4:08] posted it before, summarize it using AI
[4:10] and put it there. And then there's
[4:11] another one for grabbing uh links that
[4:14] I'd posted into a particular list and it
[4:16] kind of did a bit of commentary on that.
[4:17] It was really quite complicated and and
[4:20] difficult to run and maintain. And it
[4:22] kind of worked okay, except that 2 p.m.
[4:26] on a Monday, pretty much every Monday, I
[4:28] would get the dreaded notification from
[4:30] NA10 that my workflow had failed. And I
[4:31] was just like, "Oh, no." And then I'd
[4:33] have to go in and figure out in here
[4:36] what whatever had broken and try and run
[4:38] it and fix it. Now, this is nothing
[4:40] against NA10. NA10 is a really cool tool
[4:42] and it can do some really cool things.
[4:44] And I'd never have been able to
[4:45] orchestrate AI in the way that I was
[4:48] doing before without a tool like N810.
[4:50] despite being a coder, it's just so much
[4:52] easier to manage in here. And you can
[4:54] manage all the API keys really easily,
[4:56] and it's it's a nice tool to to stick
[4:58] things together, but it was so brittle
[5:01] to use at this kind of level of
[5:02] complexity. And I didn't get a huge
[5:04] amount of value out of it. Um, and then
[5:06] every time I fixed it, I would do
[5:08] something else. And so, honestly, it was
[5:10] probably easier for me to just write the
[5:12] newsletter than it would have been to
[5:14] maintain the thing that wrote the
[5:15] newsletter. And I probably had a
[5:17] slightly better newsletter. Uh, so this
[5:19] wasn't great. Um but but this was to my
[5:21] mind a few months ago the really the
[5:23] only way to use AI. You had to kind of
[5:25] orchestrate it and manage it, give it
[5:27] the right data and kind of handle all
[5:28] the context. And I thought that this was
[5:30] the future of automation, but it isn't
[5:33] really the future of automation. The
[5:35] future of automation is a lot more like
[5:36] something like this uh running in clawed
[5:39] code. So this is obviously not the
[5:41] actual skill, but um I have now in
[5:43] clawed code a skill that writes
[5:45] newsletters for me and it has all of
[5:47] those instructions. In fact, I copied
[5:48] and pasted the NA10 JSON code from there
[5:51] into claw code and said, "Write a skill
[5:54] based on this flow, and it did a great
[5:55] job." Um, and then what it does is it
[5:57] goes through and does all of the things.
[5:59] But what's interesting about that is how
[6:01] does claw code work? Well, it reads the
[6:03] first thing, it decides on the next
[6:04] step, and then it reads the next bit,
[6:06] and then it decides on the next step,
[6:07] and it kind of works through over some
[6:09] minutes to actually write and produce
[6:12] the newsletter that I was writing. And
[6:14] it's the same for code. It's the same
[6:15] for anything that we want to build using
[6:18] claw code. Claw kind of just takes care
[6:20] of it. You describe the kinds of things
[6:22] you want and it does it. Now what's
[6:24] interesting is that clawed code
[6:26] fundamentally is running on a loop,
[6:28] isn't it? It just reads the skill, calls
[6:31] a tool, goes back to the beginning,
[6:33] reads the skill again, calls a tool,
[6:34] calls a tool, and then at some point it
[6:36] figures out that it's done and it stops
[6:37] and it gives you your newsletter in
[6:39] whatever form you want it in. Um, so
[6:42] what's interesting is that this ships
[6:44] much better, more coherent newsletters
[6:47] than the previous uh the previous
[6:49] workflow. I still have to change them,
[6:51] write them, screw around with them, but
[6:53] but they are uh they are a much better
[6:55] first draft than they ever were. And I
[6:57] haven't really touched this skill. All I
[6:58] really do with this skill is I say at
[7:00] the end of a newsletter writing process,
[7:02] please just update the skill with
[7:03] anything you can figure out from the
[7:04] session you should have done
[7:05] differently. And it makes the odd tweak
[7:07] here and there. Um so that's a loop that
[7:11] is this kind of form of working in loops
[7:14] with AI. So so agents that originally
[7:18] start in workflows where you have quite
[7:21] complicated orchestration that looks a
[7:23] bit like something hellish like this end
[7:26] up in quite a simple loop perhaps with a
[7:28] bit better context. Now this didn't work
[7:31] for the longest time but it's now
[7:32] beginning to work with the latest models
[7:34] and by latest model I really mean GPT
[7:37] 5.8. X really GPT 5.12 onwards uh and
[7:42] Claude Opus 4.6 or Sonnet 4.6 upwards.
[7:45] So those models uh started emerging
[7:47] around about uh the end of November. Uh
[7:50] I have no idea about Mythos by the way.
[7:52] I I've spoken to people who've used it
[7:54] and they say it's it's it's good, but
[7:56] it's mostly marketing, but we'll see. Uh
[7:58] but um but yes, uh we'll see what that
[8:01] where that takes us. Maybe we won't even
[8:02] need skills. Maybe we'll just say write
[8:03] a newsletter and it'll do it. Who knows?
[8:05] Um, but what what I'm trying to my my
[8:07] point is is that rather than using
[8:09] complicated workflows, we're actually
[8:11] using skills and loops much more in
[8:14] context and loops. And any kind of agent
[8:16] that we run is in some way a loop
[8:19] already. Okay. And this kind of powerful
[8:22] looping construct is something that you
[8:25] can more generally apply. Um so what
[8:27] happens when we take loops a little bit
[8:30] further? So um the first stage um is
[8:35] this idea or the first idea came from
[8:37] Jeffrey Huntley uh a little while ago
[8:40] you know ancient times in AI which means
[8:42] probably about last June and he said
[8:45] basically what we should do is whenever
[8:47] we finish using an AI to do anything we
[8:49] should just try the thing again in some
[8:52] way we should just uh just give it
[8:54] exactly the same prompt and see what
[8:56] happens see what it does again uh and it
[8:59] sounds it sounds a bit stupid and it's
[9:00] based on. Does anyone know where this
[9:02] story comes from? Who knows why it's
[9:04] called a Ralph loop? Like two people.
[9:07] It's called a Ralph loop because of
[9:08] Ralph Wigum, which is a Simpsons
[9:10] character who basically says um the uh
[9:14] he just tries the same thing over and
[9:15] over and over again and eventually it
[9:17] works. Um and it's all it is really. All
[9:19] all that a Ralph loop is is uh build
[9:23] this thing or do this thing inside a
[9:25] prompt. Then the AI goes away and does
[9:26] the thing and then it finishes and says,
[9:28] "Okay, I've done the thing." And then it
[9:30] says, "Okay, great. Go and build this
[9:32] thing." And you know, and do all of the
[9:33] things I said to build this thing. And
[9:34] it goes, "Oh, okay. I'll do it again."
[9:36] And and the the groundbreaking nature of
[9:39] what that meant was that the uh AI would
[9:43] often review its code and realize it had
[9:46] missed something in some way, right? So,
[9:48] it figured out that uh there wasn't it
[9:52] wasn't quite finished. And this is quite
[9:53] a common problem with AI coding tools
[9:55] last year. It wasn't quite done. it
[9:58] didn't quite get to the end and
[9:59] therefore it go oh yeah I should have
[10:00] fixed that bit and then does it again
[10:02] and then and then when it stops and says
[10:04] right I'm definitely finished now 100%
[10:06] it's done it's finished and then what do
[10:08] you do you give it another prompt again
[10:09] say go away and build the feature it's
[10:10] like I've built the feature and tries
[10:11] and looks again oh yeah there was
[10:12] actually this tiny thing that I should
[10:14] have done I really am now finished and
[10:16] so on and so on so you can kind of see
[10:17] the utility of kind of going through
[10:20] that loop um where you just build the
[10:22] feature and just then ask it to build
[10:24] the feature and then you ask it to build
[10:25] the feature um So, so that's kind of the
[10:28] first stage of RF loops. And what I'd
[10:29] like us to do is I'd like us to try
[10:31] that. So, firstly, I'm going to uh do a
[10:33] bit of live coding. Hold on to your
[10:34] hats. Uh we'll see how that goes. And uh
[10:37] we're going to try and do that process
[10:39] using claude code to see where that
[10:41] takes us. So,
[10:43] um let me
[10:47] start change what I share.
[10:54] Sorry, just takes a moment.
[10:58] Okay,
[11:00] great.
[11:02] Uh, this one, can everybody see that?
[11:04] Okay, can people see that in the back?
[11:06] Okay, do you want me to increase the
[11:08] size? Got thumbs up. Great. Okay, so
[11:11] this is a piece of code that I vibe
[11:13] coded in about three minutes last night.
[11:15] So, it's not good, but we'll that's the
[11:16] whole point. We're going to fix it. Um,
[11:18] so it is literally a Pomodoro timer, and
[11:20] you can see how it works. So, if I go to
[11:21] Python and type Pomodoro
[11:24] start, woohoo, we've got a Pomodoro
[11:26] timer. Uh, that's all it does. It
[11:28] literally just does start. There is no
[11:30] way of finding out whether it's finished
[11:32] or complete or anything like that, but
[11:34] that's what we're going to change. Um,
[11:36] the other cool thing which is very
[11:37] important for any self-respecting
[11:39] vibecoded AI project is that it has
[11:41] tests. So, look, it's got a test.
[11:44] There's one test and the check to see
[11:46] whether it starts. So, that's great. So,
[11:47] if we just have a quick look, and you'll
[11:49] have to forgive me if you're not a Vim
[11:50] fan because I am. Um, we although I
[11:53] hardly use it now, it's quite sad, you
[11:55] know, 20 years of muscle memory just
[11:56] gone. But, um, but yes, so all it does
[11:58] is it literally just runs a start
[12:00] command and then it saves in your
[12:02] Pomodoro uh Pomodoro in your home
[12:04] directory. It saves the time in which
[12:06] you started. Really, really simple. So,
[12:08] this is a very simple, quite
[12:11] straightforward project. The difference
[12:13] is that it has a new folder with
[12:15] different things in it. And these are
[12:17] tickets. So there are a whole bunch of
[12:19] ways in which we could improve this
[12:21] pomodoro timer. Um and the first ticket
[12:24] is it would be really nice to know how
[12:26] long is left on our pomodoro rather than
[12:28] just starting it. Um so I' what I've
[12:30] done is I've created a very simple
[12:32] ticket system to allow us to just kind
[12:34] of capture some changes. These are not u
[12:37] this was oneshotted. So I have no idea
[12:38] if these tickets are actually good. In
[12:39] fact, I haven't looked at some of them.
[12:41] So we'll see how that goes. But um but
[12:43] the idea is that uh we can use these in
[12:46] order to start building a loop of work
[12:48] in order to get something done. So um
[12:51] what I'm going to do to start with is
[12:52] I'm going to start Claude and I'm
[12:54] literally going to say write the first
[12:56] ticket. So bear with me while Claude
[12:59] fires up.
[13:02] In some ways I'm quite glad they didn't
[13:04] actually release Mythos yesterday
[13:05] because I think I don't think it would
[13:07] be working today if they did. Uh that is
[13:10] really not working, is it? That's
[13:11] frustrating.
[13:18] >> Wow.
[13:22] Let's try again.
[13:30] >> There's a problem with Wi-Fi.
[13:32] >> Oh, okay. I mean, that could cause some
[13:35] problems to my talk, but we'll have to
[13:36] see how that goes. I don't have one of
[13:38] those fancy new um Macs that allow you
[13:40] to run. No, this has actually locked up
[13:42] my computer. Can you believe that? It
[13:44] was working literally 10 minutes ago.
[13:46] Uh let me just have a look. Uh bear with
[13:49] me while I debug my machine.
[13:53] >> Um there is um I've got I think I'm on a
[13:57] different Wi-Fi, so it should
[14:00] uh No. Yeah, the Wi-Fi has gone down.
[14:04] fun
[14:05] >> tethering time
[14:06] >> might have to be. Okay, hang on a second
[14:08] while I tether to my phone, which I
[14:11] think has decent 5G, so we should be
[14:13] good. Okay, let's see if that's any
[14:15] better.
[14:19] >> Hooray.
[14:22] Okay, let's try again. Uh, not that one.
[14:24] Um, cool. So, uh, code Pomodoro
[14:27] workshop. Okay, is that big enough?
[14:30] >> Okay, good. Let's try this Claude via
[14:33] the power of 5G. Look at that. It works.
[14:36] Fantastic. Okay. So, um, what I'm going
[14:38] to do is we have, as I said, a very,
[14:41] very simple, stupid Pomodoro timer. And
[14:45] we're going to implement a ticket. So,
[14:47] what I'm going to do is I'm going to say
[14:48] implement
[14:50] this ticket. So, it's in doc tickets
[14:53] 001.
[14:55] Great. And I'm just going to say that.
[14:57] See what happens. So, what's going to do
[14:59] is going to read the ticket, which I
[15:01] showed you briefly earlier. It's it's um
[15:03] very straightforward. And all it does is
[15:04] it implements a status to see how far
[15:07] we've got. Um and then what I would like
[15:09] it to do, what I'm going to do after
[15:11] this is I'm then going to say when it's
[15:13] done because it will literally be two
[15:14] files. It's not going to be difficult
[15:15] for it to do. And then I'm going to say,
[15:17] you know, implement it again and see
[15:19] what happens.
[15:21] So, there's a few different ways that
[15:22] you can do this. Um and there is no kind
[15:25] of one set way of doing a Ralph loop.
[15:27] It's really about the concept, not about
[15:29] anything else. Great. So, it's done the
[15:31] ticket. If I just quickly do a quick get
[15:33] diff, you can see that what it did is it
[15:35] added a status command. I think when I
[15:37] had a show of hands earlier, most of you
[15:38] are coders. So, hopefully this is not
[15:40] tricky to follow. And then we've got a
[15:42] new test. Look at that. We've added a
[15:43] test. It didn't even ask it to. It added
[15:45] a test. Oh my gosh, what is the world
[15:46] coming to? So, um, now what I'm going to
[15:49] do is I'm literally going to say the
[15:50] same thing. Now, a year ago, this would
[15:52] have been really important step because
[15:53] it would have definitely missed
[15:55] something. Um whereas now it's like you
[15:58] already done it. It's fine. Right? So
[16:00] Opus is now much better at at noticing
[16:02] when things are done. Now a traditional
[16:04] Ralph flute would just keep doing this,
[16:05] right? And it would keep going with this
[16:07] kind of implement this ticket, implement
[16:08] this ticket, implement this ticket. And
[16:10] um and this is kind of boring and it's
[16:13] not really going to do very much else.
[16:15] Um and at some point actually when I
[16:17] tried this earlier, uh it's interesting.
[16:19] It's done something different. It
[16:20] actually noticed that what it should
[16:21] have done is it actually should have
[16:23] updated the status to done. So the
[16:24] process worked that didn't work earlier.
[16:26] Uh so that's great. So it's actually
[16:28] noticed something that it didn't do. So
[16:30] there you can see the fundamental early
[16:32] principle of early Ralph loops, right?
[16:34] The idea that you can just zoom through
[16:36] and and do something and it will find
[16:38] things eventually that it missed.
[16:39] Because it missed that. I'm just going
[16:40] to try once more, but I don't think it
[16:42] will come up with anything else. Um like
[16:44] I said, latest models really don't need
[16:46] this step in quite the same way. Um they
[16:49] they tend to just kind of get it done.
[16:50] In fact, this time it's just like, um,
[16:52] oh, if you're running a Ralph loop that
[16:54] picks up the next ticket.
[16:57] Oh, that's hilarious. It's literally
[16:59] giving away my presentation. Um,
[17:03] that's fantastic. Okay. Um, what I'd
[17:05] like us to do is I think as a starting
[17:07] point, the other thing you can do is you
[17:09] can just kill the context and then you
[17:11] can do the same thing again and you can
[17:12] say implement doc tickets 001. And I
[17:15] can't bother to spell it. It'll find it.
[17:17] Um, and then, um, so now, uh, what I'm
[17:21] doing is basically doing the same thing,
[17:22] but without it knowing about the
[17:23] previous context. So, it' be quite
[17:25] interesting to see what it does with
[17:26] this. I'm assuming it'll find assuming
[17:29] it found the ticket. Yeah, it did find
[17:30] the ticket. That was easy enough for it
[17:32] to do. It's just running the test to
[17:33] make sure that they work. And it all
[17:35] passes. Okay. So, it's happy. So, some
[17:37] people when we when we first started
[17:39] using Ralph Loops is that they weren't
[17:41] doing it within the same status. And uh
[17:43] there was an early claw code plugin that
[17:45] just on the stop hook which is which is
[17:47] what runs right now when it stops
[17:49] running it would just do the same
[17:50] command again. And so rather like me
[17:52] just typing the same thing in each time
[17:54] but that didn't really work very well
[17:55] because it didn't get very far. Whereas
[17:57] uh now what's um more useful or or what
[18:00] people started doing was just running
[18:01] claude code in a kind of loop. So they
[18:03] would do something like while true um
[18:06] and then do claude
[18:08] um implement ticket 001,
[18:13] right? And then done. And then that will
[18:15] just go through. Uh not quite actually
[18:16] because I didn't do claude P, but
[18:18] effectively that's that's what they were
[18:20] doing. Um oh no, now I've really screwed
[18:22] it up. I really shouldn't have press hit
[18:24] enter on that, should I? Okay, there we
[18:26] go. So that's but that's effective what
[18:29] people were doing. The dumbest Ralph
[18:30] loop is literally that just a while loop
[18:33] and it just goes through and implements
[18:34] stuff super super easy. Um so um what is
[18:39] the next step in a RA loop? Well, in
[18:41] fact what we're going to do now is I'm
[18:43] going to get you to get to that point
[18:45] and then I'm going to take questions
[18:46] from other folks. So um let me just
[18:49] switch to
[18:50] back to here. I'm hoping. There we go.
[18:52] Yeah, great. Um, so what I'd like you to
[18:55] do if you could crack open your laptops
[18:58] and um, grab the code from here. So, um,
[19:00] it's just on my GitHub uh, as Pomodoro
[19:02] workshop. You should be able to find
[19:03] that quite easily. Um, and you saw how I
[19:06] ran it. It's very simple. Uh, you might
[19:08] need to set up Python in your machine.
[19:10] So, there's hopefully that won't be too
[19:11] hard or you just run bare Python.
[19:14] Pomodoro.py will give you the command
[19:16] you can type and then it's um, just a
[19:18] unit test thing to run the test
[19:20] pomodoro. Super easy. And then in step
[19:22] four, I want you to fire up Clawed Code
[19:24] or Codeex and I want you to try and
[19:26] build that ticket and make sure that
[19:27] it's working. Um, and that will be a
[19:30] great starting point. Um, but don't
[19:31] build any more tickets yet. Don't don't
[19:33] let it take you too far. And then, uh,
[19:35] if you are really used to that and that
[19:37] is just like a literal no-brainer for
[19:39] you, try in codeex, try in something
[19:41] else. Try in maybe try setting up
[19:44] something similar in one of your own
[19:46] projects. Um, so something different.
[19:48] So, I'm I'm going to take questions now
[19:49] while people are typing away on that.
[19:51] I'm going to give you maybe a few
[19:52] minutes just to get that set up and then
[19:53] we'll kind of move on to the next step.
[19:55] Does anyone have any questions or
[19:57] comments or thoughts? I have a
[19:59] microphone here.
[20:01] Uh if people would like to ask anything.
[20:03] Yeah,
[20:07] there we go.
[20:10] >> It should come on in a second.
[20:13] >> Hopefully,
[20:15] the guys at the back are
[20:18] It may not be on. Is it on?
[20:21] >> Yeah, you could shout and I repeat.
[20:23] Yeah, that could work.
[20:24] >> Is it? Can I just check it's on first?
[20:29] >> Yeah, it looks on. That's weird. Shout
[20:30] and I repeat. Anyway, oh, there we go.
[20:32] There we go.
[20:33] >> Great.
[20:33] >> Um, I've I've played a bit around with
[20:36] the BMAD method, which I don't know
[20:38] whether you've seen that. Um he's got a
[20:40] guy a guy who's basically written a
[20:42] whole load of skills and commands for
[20:45] following a full agile process from
[20:48] >> you know and he's got an agent for build
[20:51] it test it
[20:53] >> you know everything and and I I guess
[20:56] >> so
[20:58] um have have you done anything where
[21:01] sort of using this kind of Ralph loop
[21:03] process you go through that cycle you go
[21:05] through the full software development
[21:07] life cycle of each stage and then Yes.
[21:10] Um I I might get as far as that at the
[21:13] end. Um but yes, I have tried some of
[21:15] that stuff. Um it's really interesting
[21:17] and it answer it asks some really very
[21:20] good questions both around context and
[21:25] and actually the value of the work. It's
[21:27] really interesting. So yeah, we'll talk
[21:29] about maybe that a bit more at the end.
[21:30] So ask again if I haven't got to it,
[21:32] just ask the same question again and
[21:33] we'll get there in a raffle.
[21:35] >> Okay. Thank you.
[21:35] >> Um anybody else got any questions?
[21:38] How are people getting on with setting
[21:40] that up? Have has anyone managed to set
[21:41] it up? You know, kind of wave at me if
[21:43] you've managed to get it running. Great.
[21:44] Great start. Has anyone managed to
[21:45] implement the first ticket? Hooray. A
[21:48] few people. You got a question?
[21:50] >> Oh, go. You've done it. Great. Fab.
[21:51] Yeah, I probably should have given
[21:52] different directions for asking a
[21:54] question versus having finished. That's
[21:56] great. So, a few people have got
[21:57] started. Fantastic. Great. So, you can
[22:01] probably tell where this is going. And
[22:02] if you were paying attention to the live
[22:03] demo, you'll already know the answer.
[22:05] I'll grab the mic from you so you don't
[22:06] have to keep holding that. Thank you.
[22:08] Um, but yes, you don't have to just stop
[22:12] at one ticket. Now, is Matt PCO happen
[22:15] to be in the room? I know that he's
[22:18] doing the workshop after this one. He is
[22:19] the person I got this from. So, if he's
[22:21] watching the video, thank you, Matt. Uh,
[22:23] this was a this was a a revelation to me
[22:25] back in sort of September last year.
[22:26] Posted a brilliant YouTube video just
[22:28] about exactly how to kind of take Ralph
[22:30] loops to the next level because when
[22:32] they first came out, I spotted it on the
[22:34] internet. I played with it and I was
[22:35] like, "Yeah, this is fine. It's kind of
[22:37] cool. It kind of spots things that AI
[22:39] can do where where it's missed things
[22:41] and it can maybe do a slightly better
[22:43] job of things, but it's not going to
[22:44] change everything that I do. Um, and
[22:48] then the answer is actually it does
[22:49] change the entire way that I work and
[22:52] approach code now. So, um, I guess the
[22:56] the really interesting thing is not how
[22:58] do I make sure Claude has finished this
[23:00] one thing. It's what happens if I point
[23:02] this kind of loop at a whole pile of
[23:05] things to do, right? What happens when
[23:07] we point at a whole list of things? Now,
[23:10] I tried this. I I wrote a blog post
[23:13] about this, which was a bit depressing
[23:14] because it just showed abject failure in
[23:16] the entire post to be honest, but it was
[23:18] more about I tried what I tried to do is
[23:20] I tried to get um Claude, I think it was
[23:23] Claude at the time, to break up a big
[23:25] project into a lot of different tickets.
[23:27] And then I got it to break down all of
[23:29] those tickets into smaller tickets. And
[23:30] then I got it to to figure out what all
[23:32] the dependencies were between those
[23:34] tickets and write them all down really
[23:35] carefully. And then I got it to figure
[23:38] out how I it could use like a ton of
[23:40] different agents. Sorry. Did you have a
[23:41] question?
[23:52] Uh one, two, one, two. Okay. I have a
[23:54] problem with I had a problem with Wi-Fi
[23:56] and I didn't do the clone.
[23:58] >> Oh, I'm sorry. Go to this one.
[23:59] >> Yeah. Yeah. Couple of minutes. Yeah.
[24:00] Thank you.
[24:01] >> Yeah, that's fine. I'll leave it on
[24:02] there. That's fine. Um has everyone
[24:04] appreciated the slide. Okay, good. Okay,
[24:06] there we go.
[24:07] >> Um so, um these slides, by the way, are
[24:10] created using a slide skill using Nano
[24:12] Banana Pro. It's absolutely incredible
[24:13] at making slides. Um, I didn't I haven't
[24:16] apart from like the tiniest thing like
[24:19] adding a QR code, I haven't added any
[24:21] text to these slides. They're just flat
[24:23] images in Google Slides. Um, they're
[24:25] actually it's incredible at making
[24:27] slides. Um, what was I saying? Yeah. So,
[24:29] uh, so the idea of just creating
[24:33] uh a a Ralph loop to just do one thing
[24:35] seemed a bit pointless and and it was
[24:37] just working around a few limitations.
[24:39] If you point this loop on a whole pile
[24:42] of work, then it becomes incredibly
[24:45] uh powerful. And as I was saying before,
[24:48] I created this huge complex dependency
[24:51] graph with a whole ton of different
[24:52] tickets about how I was going to build
[24:54] this really complex system for me. And
[24:56] then I got I fired up like six or seven
[24:59] parallel agents and I was like, "Right,
[25:00] you do one stream and you do that stream
[25:02] and you pick up this ticket." And it
[25:04] just failed horribly because the the
[25:06] system just couldn't figure out what had
[25:08] been done and what hadn't been done.
[25:09] Picked up there was lots of contention
[25:10] between tickets like well I can't do
[25:12] anything until you until I get that
[25:13] share ticket done so I'm going to do it.
[25:15] And another Claude was like well I can't
[25:16] do anything until that share tickets
[25:17] done so I'm going to do that too. And
[25:18] then they both implemented the same
[25:20] thing and it was a huge mess. So that
[25:22] was really very depressing and I wrote a
[25:24] whole thing about it and I was basically
[25:25] like it's impossible to orchestrate
[25:28] large numbers of agents you know you
[25:29] just can't do it which was obviously
[25:31] nonsense but um that's how I felt at the
[25:33] time and what was interesting was that
[25:35] what I'd done effectively was recreate
[25:39] the waterfall processes that were seen
[25:40] in some of the worst companies back when
[25:43] I was starting to code for myself in the
[25:45] 90s where people would write
[25:47] requirements documents that you had to
[25:48] stagger to carry into the the
[25:50] requirements meetings.
[25:51] uh where the the entire project was
[25:54] specified up front with all the
[25:55] intricate dependencies handed to the
[25:57] development team and then given two
[25:58] years to build. I can see some perhaps
[26:01] um slightly more seasoned people in the
[26:03] room sort of nodding and smiling at me
[26:05] when when they hear me talk about this
[26:07] but yeah I thankfully managed to avoid
[26:09] working on any of those teams but I some
[26:11] of my friends did and it was absolutely
[26:13] awful. And what I had done is basically
[26:15] I had given that to Claude to do. I'd
[26:17] given that waterfall process to Claude
[26:20] to to um to organize and figure out as
[26:23] as it went, which was really bad. So no
[26:25] wonder it didn't work. If humans can't
[26:27] do that, how was how is AI supposed to
[26:28] do any better? Um however, if instead of
[26:32] saying with all of your tickets, right,
[26:35] the first one is the most important,
[26:36] then this one, and then you should do
[26:38] this one, but don't think about this one
[26:39] until you've done that one. Instead of
[26:40] doing that, I'm going to go back for
[26:42] just a minute. Are we all good with this
[26:43] slide? By the way, does anyone still
[26:44] need the slide? Okay. Okay, we're good.
[26:47] Right. Uh instead of doing that, you can
[26:50] just run a loop where you say something
[26:52] like, "Hey, just pick the next most
[26:55] important ticket."
[26:57] It's as simple as that. Just figure out
[26:58] here are all the tickets. Just figure
[27:00] out what is the most important next one
[27:02] to run. Okay? You don't have to worry
[27:04] about the dependencies. You don't have
[27:05] to figure it out yourself. the AI is
[27:07] quite capable of looking at all of them,
[27:09] figuring out the dependencies on the fly
[27:10] based on what's just been done and
[27:13] figuring out what the next most
[27:15] important thing to do is. That's
[27:16] actually quite easy for an AI to do. The
[27:19] one thing it cannot do so easily is
[27:21] manage that process in parallel. But to
[27:23] be honest, when we're running these kind
[27:25] of loops, if you're running them
[27:26] continually, the bottleneck is usually
[27:28] not the number of agents. It's usually
[27:29] you just keeping up with the AI just
[27:31] doing things over and over again. So
[27:33] let's forget parallelism just for a
[27:34] minute and just start with a loop. See,
[27:36] if you can keep up with an AI, just one
[27:38] AI that's running continuously, you're
[27:40] fine. Don't worry about parallelism just
[27:41] yet. Don't worry about gas town, any of
[27:42] that stuff just yet. As impressive as
[27:44] those projects are, you can just start
[27:46] with a simple loop. It is okay. So, um,
[27:48] what I'd like you to do again at this
[27:50] point is I'm going to quickly show how
[27:53] this works for those of you um, who
[27:55] don't have your laptops, but then I'd
[27:56] like you to just try it on your
[27:58] computer. So again, let me find my mouse
[28:03] and then move to
[28:08] sharing my screen again. Okay,
[28:13] great. So if I go back to Claude, in
[28:16] fact, I'll go back to Vim first and look
[28:17] at the tickets folder. So I've got a
[28:19] whole bunch of tickets here. I've got a
[28:21] status command, I've got a stop command,
[28:23] I've got custom durations. Never use
[28:25] that anyway. I use um other things like
[28:28] you know labels and all of that. Um I
[28:30] could try and figure out the
[28:31] dependencies myself but I really just
[28:32] don't need to. I can just simply go into
[28:34] Claude and say implement the next most
[28:39] important ticket using
[28:42] uh TDD
[28:45] principles
[28:48] from doc tickets.
[28:52] um commit
[28:55] when done. Something like that. Okay.
[29:02] So, let's see what it does.
[29:08] So, it's now reading a whole bunch of
[29:09] tickets. As you can see, it's read
[29:11] number one, two, and three, and it's
[29:13] decided that the next one is number two.
[29:14] It's just going to do it. That's great.
[29:16] So, it's going to work on it. Um, now
[29:19] the interesting thing now is that once
[29:21] this is finishes, now it's using TDD, so
[29:23] it read the test first. Uh, when it
[29:25] finishes, hopefully, yeah, it's marked
[29:28] it as done. Very good. Remembered that
[29:30] time
[29:33] and then it should commit. Let's see if
[29:35] it does.
[29:41] >> Sorry.
[29:44] >> No, this is a brand new session.
[29:46] Although I think it probably had the
[29:48] working directory from the previous one
[29:50] still. So um in fact I think it has. So
[29:53] what it hasn't done is committed those
[29:55] atomically which is definitely something
[29:56] I could improve in my prompt but we can
[29:58] cover that in a minute. Um so then
[30:01] hopefully it's just going to do that
[30:04] and then it's going to finish.
[30:07] Yeah, great. It's done it. Fantastic.
[30:10] Now what I can do is I can either do
[30:12] that again uh as a row loop or I can
[30:14] just restart a new session. Just do the
[30:17] same thing and this time it will pick
[30:18] something else and then it will keep
[30:19] working. Now you can imagine that if I
[30:21] put this inside a while loop then it
[30:24] should in theory work through all of the
[30:26] tickets in some way. Now whether what I
[30:29] get at the end is actually what I want
[30:31] is a whole different question. Um but it
[30:34] will definitely get a lot of work done
[30:36] in a row. So I'd love you to try it. So,
[30:39] if you're if you've got the um app
[30:40] working on your computers, um see if you
[30:43] can get it to work through just as many
[30:46] tickets as you want to within that
[30:48] amount of time. Um so, it should be able
[30:51] to just carry on. See if you can get it
[30:52] to to actually um uh maybe write a
[30:56] little bash script um just like I've
[30:58] done where you do a while, true, and
[30:59] then claude. I'll show you how to do
[31:01] that briefly. In fact, if I just quickly
[31:03] get reset so it can start just from the
[31:05] beginning. Um, and in fact, I'm actually
[31:07] going to go up one more
[31:11] hard
[31:13] head. There we go. Great. Yeah, that's
[31:15] the right place to start. Um, so, uh, if
[31:19] you can get it to do that, then that's
[31:20] great. The other thing that you can do
[31:22] is instead of using claude like this,
[31:24] you can do claw-p. Can you all see that?
[31:27] Okay. By the way, I'm not sure how I can
[31:28] make that. Um,
[31:32] >> yeah. Yeah, clear is a good one. Yeah.
[31:35] clear
[31:37] claude. There we go. So, what we can do
[31:39] is actually use claude.p like this. And
[31:41] you can get it to output by just doing
[31:43] stream JSON or something like that.
[31:44] What's it called? Something like stream
[31:46] JSON.
[31:47] Um, hang on a second.
[31:52] Let's see.
[31:56] Um,
[32:00] I think they've removed it. That's
[32:01] annoying. Never mind.
[32:04] which won't see any output.
[32:07] So there's nothing to stop you setting
[32:09] it up like this and then you can just do
[32:12] that.
[32:14] >> You got to set up CL to have full
[32:15] permission so it doesn't properly.
[32:17] >> Yes. So the only way that this works is
[32:19] if you want to run this properly and for
[32:21] it to not stop, you have to be quite
[32:23] selective about the permissions that you
[32:24] give it. Um so the question was
[32:26] presumably you have to run claw with
[32:28] full permissions for this to work. Yes.
[32:30] Yes, you do. Um
[32:32] >> it depends on what you're doing. Yeah,
[32:33] if you're working in a little sandbox
[32:35] project like this, the chances of it
[32:36] going elsewhere to find stuff out is is
[32:38] very small. Um, I have a project called
[32:40] lockbox and the sole purpose of that is
[32:42] to try and stop it doing stupid stuff um
[32:45] by why when it reads untrusted tokens
[32:47] which could potentially send it off
[32:49] track, it um it basically just prevents
[32:51] any kind of file system access or
[32:53] anything after that. So, there are ways
[32:54] of of kind of managing it. Um, so what
[32:56] this is doing in the background is you
[32:57] can't actually see it doing anything um
[33:00] because I don't have that that output
[33:02] mode, but you can figure out basically
[33:05] that to to run this in in some kind of
[33:07] script. And if I in fact if I quit that
[33:10] um hopefully it will stop.
[33:13] There we go. No,
[33:15] let's just keep going. Sorry. Clearly
[33:18] clearly a more productionready Ralph
[33:20] loop would not look like this. But you
[33:21] can see it's done a bunch of work. So if
[33:23] I go to here, you can see it's already
[33:24] started on the status command. Um, and
[33:27] it's just working through that at the
[33:28] moment. So it started at the beginning
[33:29] again. It was just working. So um,
[33:32] there's a few things to be aware of
[33:33] here. One is that feedback is really
[33:35] really important with Ralph loops. Um,
[33:38] you know, you need to be able to have it
[33:39] run uh um in a uh in a way that you can
[33:44] tell what it's doing and how it's doing
[33:45] it. So this kind of super basic one that
[33:47] I've given you there isn't very good.
[33:49] That's not one that I would recommend
[33:51] running in production. Um, equally, you
[33:54] need to um figure out exactly what the
[33:58] prompt is for Ralph. And that's a
[33:59] really, really important point. And I
[34:01] think what I'd like you to do when
[34:02] you're trying this is yes, it's going to
[34:04] be building a bunch of tickets in a row,
[34:06] but equally, it's going to be um uh it's
[34:10] going to be doing them in a way that you
[34:11] don't like. Um so for example if we go
[34:15] if I'm if I'm running this test which is
[34:17] literally just implement the next most
[34:19] important thing uh let's start with this
[34:21] one
[34:23] um I would probably do something like um
[34:27] run simplify
[34:30] which is a really useful skill from
[34:31] Claude from the anthropic team uh when
[34:34] finished and ensure you refactor to
[34:39] reduce duplication you can imagine
[34:42] Imagine that you could create quite a
[34:44] complicated um skill for this. And I'll
[34:46] show you I'll show you my kind of actual
[34:48] skill for this at the end. But as you're
[34:50] kind of working through this, do try and
[34:53] figure out um if there's ways that you
[34:57] can improve what it's doing. So give it
[34:58] a go, let it make a decision, and then
[35:01] let it write some code and then read the
[35:04] code and think, okay, what could I have
[35:05] actually improved about that process?
[35:06] And then reset everything and then
[35:08] improve the prompt after that. um have a
[35:10] go at that and see how that works.
[35:12] Whilst people are kind of working
[35:13] through that on their machines, I'm
[35:15] happy to take questions.
[35:19] >> Yeah.
[35:23] >> Have you used the skills like
[35:25] superpowers? Uh
[35:27] >> which one? Sorry.
[35:28] >> Superpowers one.
[35:29] >> Uh the superpowers one. I what I did is
[35:31] I pointed Claude at the entire
[35:33] repository and said figure out anything
[35:35] that isn't currently in my skill set and
[35:37] um implement them for me with my own
[35:39] context and that worked quite well. So I
[35:40] haven't used those ones particularly but
[35:42] I've basically rip them off.
[35:44] >> That's great. Um then because I use
[35:47] superpowers a lot and then I just give
[35:50] tasks like this and then ask it to like
[35:52] >> run multiple agents in the background.
[35:54] Yeah. And have you done that is what I
[35:56] >> Yeah. Yeah. So what you can do is there
[35:57] is an agent teams version which I think
[35:59] I've got turned off in this particular
[36:01] instance of cla code but what can happen
[36:03] is you can get uh claude to um use uh
[36:07] sub aents within team. So in fact I
[36:10] think I might be able to turn that on if
[36:11] I can find the agent teams. There it is.
[36:14] Claude code experimental agent teams. So
[36:16] if I grab that
[36:19] and then run Claude with that on
[36:24] then you should be able to say use an
[36:26] agent team to implement the dock tickets
[36:30] in this repo or something like this. And
[36:33] I don't this isn't actually running
[36:35] within T-Max. So um so actually maybe
[36:38] this won't work. So I might just try
[36:40] this again.
[36:42] Bear with me a second. So if I grab that
[36:46] and then paste that there. And then grab
[36:49] that and then run T-Max.
[36:53] And then
[36:55] run that in theory. In theory, um this
[37:00] should uh start pulling up other agents
[37:03] and it and because like I said trying to
[37:06] orchestrate uh Ralph loops or
[37:08] orchestrate agents myself to try and
[37:10] organize all of the dependencies and
[37:11] complexities is actually really really
[37:13] difficult to do. But um what you can do
[37:16] is just give the job to Claude to do and
[37:18] it does a much better job of managing
[37:20] that for it. So as you can see it's
[37:22] already decided to print out the entire
[37:24] thing, the file name and the the ticket
[37:26] for each and it's got a whole bunch
[37:28] there. So it's actually decided that
[37:30] they're all sequential. So therefore it
[37:33] should run it should run none of them in
[37:34] parallel which is kind of interesting.
[37:36] Um and then it should in theory start an
[37:38] implementation agent. Let's see if it's
[37:40] going to uh
[37:43] I think it's just running as a sub
[37:45] agent. Never mind. I'm not sure that's
[37:48] going to work. Never mind. If you can
[37:50] get it to do it, then let me know. But
[37:51] but but basically, it's an experimental
[37:53] feature that only came out a few weeks
[37:54] ago that allow um it to kind of start
[37:57] sub agents include as well um in order
[37:59] to do things.
[38:01] Any other questions while people are
[38:02] working through that? Yeah.
[38:04] >> You said you built a rough with
[38:07] automation, right? So what was the
[38:10] feedback criteria? So like what decides
[38:13] if it's a good newspaper article like a
[38:17] website
[38:18] framework but what good looks like if
[38:21] that's dynamic if that's static do you
[38:23] put that in the cloud MD file?
[38:25] >> Yeah great question how does that how
[38:26] does that work? So, so um the question
[38:28] is just to to repeat the first half of
[38:30] that is when I used the NA10 workflow in
[38:32] order to build a Ralph flute for a
[38:33] newsletter creator, uh how did I know
[38:35] how did how did the agent know what good
[38:37] was when it come?
[38:39] >> How did I define good? Okay, great
[38:41] question. So, so in terms of
[38:43] newsletters, I had already been writing
[38:44] my newsletter manually. So, I knew
[38:47] roughly what I wanted it to read like
[38:49] and sound like. I also did a bunch of
[38:51] research um using a research skill which
[38:54] was something like which I built which
[38:56] is something like um great newsletters
[38:59] and I've also did things like that. I
[39:01] also said things like um this is a
[39:04] fantastic
[39:06] written new in fact I'm just going to
[39:08] this is not what I do I actually do this
[39:10] is a fantastic newsletter that I've
[39:11] written or that I've read somewhere
[39:13] could you please figure out why this is
[39:14] so good and what are the kind of
[39:16] editorial principles that go went into
[39:18] this newsletter for it to to work really
[39:20] really well and then I would just paste
[39:22] that into paste the newsletter in get it
[39:25] to figure out what what was good about
[39:27] the newsletter and then and then I would
[39:29] check it and then I would say yes
[39:30] there's still is an element of human
[39:32] taste here. You can't entirely get away
[39:34] with that. Having said that, I do also
[39:35] have a simulate audience skill which um
[39:38] basically uses a whole bunch of
[39:40] different personas uh for different
[39:42] clients or or prospective clients that I
[39:44] work with. And then I would run it run
[39:46] the finished newsletter through that and
[39:48] say run all of these in parallel um and
[39:51] then once you have finished that figure
[39:53] out ways that I can improve this
[39:55] newsletter or newsletter skill in order
[39:57] to do that. So there's a number of
[39:58] different ways you can do that. the kind
[39:59] of audience simulation is super
[40:00] experimental, but it's actually really
[40:02] effective and and often will will
[40:04] surface insights I just hadn't thought
[40:06] of. Um I'm u my my personality as I'm a
[40:10] bit slightly all over the place,
[40:11] slightly kind of the way that I talk and
[40:13] and communicate um often my clients are
[40:15] not like that. So um I tend to barge
[40:18] people with information and sometimes my
[40:19] skill will say okay there's a lot of
[40:21] ideas in this Chris you just need to
[40:23] focus on one main point that makes sense
[40:24] and I'm like that's so helpful. So um so
[40:27] yes what's quite helpful and interesting
[40:29] is that you can use AI to give feedback
[40:31] on AI like that. The great thing about
[40:33] this particular
[40:35] um project that we're writing this
[40:37] little pomodoro thing that people are
[40:38] writing is that it's a command line tool
[40:40] and it's really simple to know whether
[40:42] it works. So it's perfect for a Ralph
[40:44] loop and in fact these little tools that
[40:46] we build for ourselves like for example
[40:48] the newsletter skill perfect for this
[40:50] kind of loop. I I will often say, "I
[40:52] want to improve this skill. Could you
[40:54] please back and forth and and write the
[40:57] content, then use another agent to read
[40:58] the content, decide if it's any good,
[41:00] come up with things to improve, then
[41:02] send that back in and just run that as a
[41:03] loop. Um there's a really cool um I
[41:07] wasn't going to tell you about this
[41:07] until the end, but I'll tell you now."
[41:09] Um there's a really cool uh feature
[41:11] inside code called loop where is instead
[41:14] of um creating, in fact, I'll start this
[41:16] in a new session. Instead of just doing
[41:19] this thing where you have to create your
[41:20] own while loop, you can say loop every
[41:23] minute um build the next ticket
[41:28] from doc tickets basically. And then
[41:31] what will happen is um the loop will set
[41:34] up a um a kind of almost like a a repeat
[41:37] timer. And as you see it's it's got a
[41:39] cron create tool which for the
[41:41] uninitiated just means do something
[41:43] every minute. This is what those five
[41:44] stars mean. And um what it's going to do
[41:46] is it will literally just build the next
[41:47] ticket. It when it finishes it will then
[41:50] check the chron again, build the next
[41:51] ticket. When it finishes it will check
[41:53] the chron again and keep going. So
[41:55] that's great for working through a bunch
[41:57] of tickets, but it isn't just applied to
[42:00] a set of things that you've got from
[42:02] before. If you think about it, I'll just
[42:04] leave that running up there. You could
[42:05] have a loop that does something like
[42:07] this. loop every one hour check linear
[42:11] for new bug reports from test.
[42:17] Um and then
[42:22] I just leave that running. Um, oh yeah,
[42:34] can't spell.
[42:38] Um, just leave that running and um,
[42:40] you're going to get you're going to
[42:40] annoy your testing team. But but anyway,
[42:42] the point is is that you can run these
[42:44] kinds of loops in order to get work done
[42:48] in a in a in a quite an interesting,
[42:52] I guess, dynamic way. Even though it's
[42:54] quite a simple loop, it's just find the
[42:55] next thing, do the next thing. If you
[42:57] think about it, heck of a lot of our
[42:59] work is just loops. If we're software
[43:01] developers, what do we do? We look at
[43:02] the backlog. We pick the top thing from
[43:04] the backlog. We pull it over to, you
[43:07] know, in progress. We assign it to
[43:08] ourselves. We check on the architecture.
[43:10] We figure out whether there's other
[43:12] contexts we need. We uh look at the
[43:14] change. We we make the change. We submit
[43:16] a PR. We um uh you know wait for
[43:20] reviews. We uh comment on the reviews.
[43:23] We reject the reviews. We implement the
[43:24] changes occasionally. We submit the PR.
[43:26] We merge the PR. We then go through the
[43:27] release process. Then we start again,
[43:29] pick up the next ticket, and so on. That
[43:31] is a loop. It's quite a complicated one.
[43:33] Um like we were talking about just a
[43:35] minute ago, but but it is still a loop.
[43:36] It is possible to get an AI to run that
[43:38] entire loop. there's no reason not to.
[43:41] Um, and that's effectively what's
[43:42] happening here when when um you can set
[43:45] up in fact you would never actually
[43:46] write this. You would much more likely
[43:48] to write something like this where you'd
[43:50] say every one hour
[43:54] uh linear
[43:56] bug finding and you'd have a skill that
[43:59] encoded all of those um those chunks of
[44:03] information that I just gave it in a way
[44:04] that would work for you and your
[44:06] particular team. Does everyone does
[44:07] anyone not know what skills are before I
[44:09] go any further? No. I think pretty much
[44:12] almost everyone knows what skills are.
[44:13] If you haven't figured out what a skill
[44:15] is yet, then then this is your homework.
[44:16] Go and understand how skills work. They
[44:18] are the best uh way that we have at the
[44:21] moment of packaging up useful little
[44:24] parcels of context and scripts and
[44:26] moving them to different places or or
[44:28] creating different things. So, for
[44:30] example, I mean, I have about 50 of them
[44:31] that I've written. Um, and then they
[44:33] just do lots of different things. The
[44:35] great thing about skills is that you can
[44:37] pull them into your context whenever you
[44:40] need them. So, for example, and I'll
[44:42] just do this. I could say, "Do you know
[44:45] how to create images using
[44:49] uh nano banana?" And I can ask um the AI
[44:53] the question, and the answer is, well, I
[44:54] could kind of look this up um but it
[44:56] actually knows that I have an image
[44:57] skill for this, funny enough. But if you
[44:59] hadn't got one, it wouldn't know. But if
[45:00] I then do images and say uh how do you
[45:04] create images? Give me the step by step.
[45:10] Then and what it's going to do is it's
[45:11] going to pull in that images skill. Um
[45:14] and then it tells me exactly how it does
[45:15] it. And I've actually written in fact I
[45:17] will make that bigger so you can see
[45:19] I've actually written a script within
[45:21] that skill that actually does the
[45:22] generation for me. Um, so it's codified
[45:25] the process of doing that and it just
[45:27] picks whichever um, uh, model it wants
[45:30] to and it gives it content and I have
[45:32] these specific templates that I use in
[45:34] order to create specific Nanabanana um,
[45:37] skills. Nanaban is brilliant. Um, this
[45:39] is how I created the presentation that
[45:41] you're looking at. I have a slide skill
[45:42] and an image skill that work in tandem
[45:44] in order to create these presentations.
[45:47] Cool. So let's see what the other thing
[45:49] has done. As you can see, it's already
[45:50] on ticket six. Um, the great thing about
[45:52] Ralphs is you just keep working and keep
[45:54] talking about something else and it's
[45:56] done a whole ton of stuff here. And it's
[45:58] just stopped at this point, but in a
[45:59] second, um, hopefully if we just wait,
[46:04] it will start the whole process again.
[46:06] There we go. It's got the scheduled task
[46:07] to run and it's going again. Um, so you
[46:10] can just you you can just leave claw
[46:12] code sessions uh running with these kind
[46:15] of loops in them. They last about three
[46:16] days, so you do have to keep refreshing
[46:18] them. Um, but you can you can just do
[46:20] that and keep it running even before you
[46:23] get to a more complicated write a script
[46:25] that wraps claw to do a thing and all of
[46:27] those kinds of things. Um, any other
[46:30] questions?
[46:33] Anyone got anything interesting or
[46:34] surprising out of their Ralph loop? Has
[46:36] anyone tried this on their real work
[46:37] yet? This would be the interesting
[46:39] thing. Yeah. How what was your
[46:42] experience? Have you still got the mic?
[46:44] >> Yeah.
[46:44] >> Yeah. Yeah.
[46:46] I just made a screenshot Ralph loop for
[46:48] a website context engineing framework.
[46:50] So Claude just takes the screenshots and
[46:52] then looks at the layout because it has
[46:53] problems with geometric like spacing.
[46:56] >> It works well.
[46:57] >> Nice. Cool. So you're actually using
[46:59] Claude Claude screenshotting to to get
[47:01] feedback. Yeah.
[47:01] >> Yeah. That's pretty advanced. Not many
[47:03] people are doing that. The um people are
[47:04] trying to use um uh like um playright
[47:08] and things like that as well to take
[47:10] screenshots and the claudin chrome
[47:11] plugin that comes with claude as well.
[47:13] can use that in order to get it to drive
[47:15] Chrome and then take screenshots of
[47:16] what's going on. I've had mixed success
[47:18] with that because it it's quite a
[47:19] complex thing for it to manage. But but
[47:21] for just basic screenshots, it works
[47:23] really well. For my um images and
[47:25] content uh that I write, um I when it
[47:29] runs those images skills, it will always
[47:31] look at the images first to see whether
[47:33] there's any kind of a weird AI garble
[47:35] text or whatever and it will reject them
[47:37] without even showing me if there's a
[47:38] problem with an image. Um was there
[47:40] another question or comment? Yeah,
[47:41] there's a question just back here. Can
[47:43] you just pass the mic? Is that okay?
[47:45] Thank you so much.
[47:51] >> Um I think it's it's close to a question
[47:53] that has been already asked. Um because
[47:55] I'm not quite familiar with Rough Loops.
[47:58] If I ask the agent to implement task one
[48:02] that has already been implemented, would
[48:04] it actually check the quality of what
[48:06] was implemented or only check if it was
[48:08] done or not or marked or not? Yeah, it
[48:11] very much depends on what you set it up
[48:13] for. So, so there's no kind of magic to
[48:16] a Ralph loop. It's just a loop. So, this
[48:18] loop that I'm running at the moment, in
[48:19] fact, I probably should just say loop
[48:20] stop. Otherwise, it's going to keep
[48:21] going. Use my quotota. I think I think
[48:24] you can just stop like that. We've got a
[48:26] quite a fully featured pomodoro setup
[48:29] now.
[48:31] Come on. Time to stop. Um, so it depends
[48:34] on it entirely depends on what you
[48:35] write. So, if you um if you go through
[48:39] to what was the loop that I set up? I
[48:41] think it was this one. I just said build
[48:43] the next ticket. That's very ambiguous
[48:45] and not very helpful. So, it might not
[48:48] actually finish it. It may just decide
[48:50] to build it and not ship it. It may not
[48:52] actually be very helpful. So, what's
[48:54] more interesting is if you go to um let
[48:58] me probably the easiest thing to do. If
[49:00] I load my my Ralph skill,
[49:05] this is my actual skill that I use um
[49:07] for Ralph loops. So um and what I'm
[49:09] doing actually this is slightly out of
[49:11] date. Um but the one that I've got here
[49:13] is actually using a doc changes folder.
[49:16] Uh you can see that there, but um I
[49:18] using a doc tickets in this example, but
[49:20] I've changed it on the the latest one.
[49:22] Um but um but ultimately you don't have
[49:24] to use a ticketing system like a flat
[49:27] file in a in a um in the GitHub
[49:29] repository. You could use beads which is
[49:31] Steve Yaki's version of of this kind of
[49:33] approach which is quite cool. I've used
[49:35] it. Um you could use linear, you could
[49:38] use Jira, you could you know as long as
[49:39] you can get access to it from the AI,
[49:41] you can use whatever uh ticketing system
[49:44] you want. uh for this for the purposes
[49:46] of this exercise that you're working
[49:47] through I tend just to use uh flat files
[49:51] because they just work you know it's not
[49:53] you don't really need anything
[49:54] sophisticated um in the same way um the
[49:58] uh the Ralph loop is entirely what you
[50:00] make it in terms of its effectiveness so
[50:03] so for example um in this particular one
[50:06] um I've given it a proper kind of role
[50:08] in the sense that you are one engineer
[50:09] in a relay team do exactly one change
[50:12] then drop the context and stop start
[50:14] Again, that's the idea. So, for this
[50:15] one, it's designed to be run in a shell
[50:17] script where it has an entirely fresh
[50:18] context each time because I didn't want
[50:20] the context to pollute each time. These
[50:22] days, I care much less about that
[50:24] because context is so much larger than
[50:26] it used to be. But, um, but when I wrote
[50:27] this, that was very important. As you
[50:29] can see, it's specifically for code that
[50:31] doesn't need human review before
[50:33] shipping. Um and then basically um it
[50:38] tells you about when work should go in
[50:39] there. Uh what the right time for the
[50:41] tool is read the claw.md change the
[50:44] format. This is the format of a ticket.
[50:47] Um this is all of the rationale. These
[50:49] are the different status values. Um I
[50:52] ask it to check git state um to make
[50:54] sure that it hasn't got a working
[50:55] directory. Um it's also got you know
[50:57] recovery states. So if it crashed, it
[51:00] knows that if there's a a dirty working
[51:02] tree, but the tests are passing, but
[51:04] you're probably done, um, but you might
[51:05] not be, so just double check. If the
[51:08] tests are failing, um, then it's
[51:10] probably just mid-flight, but broken, so
[51:12] you should probably just throw it away
[51:13] or or just treat it differently. So, so
[51:15] you can you can imagine that this was
[51:17] built up over time of trying to trying
[51:19] to get this working, trying to
[51:20] understand what the user wants, make
[51:21] sure test passing is not enough, verify
[51:24] the actual behavior works, run things in
[51:26] parallel, mark it done, blah blah blah
[51:28] blah blah. There's an awful lot going
[51:29] on. Um, so with a real Ralph loop, you
[51:32] want to be building up over time for
[51:33] your specific project exactly how to
[51:35] check something is working, exactly how
[51:37] to run the test in your particular
[51:39] framework and dialect, how you submit
[51:41] things to the test team, how you want to
[51:44] uh comment on particular changes, what
[51:46] style you want to use, whether you want
[51:49] to um pull off the thing that feels most
[51:52] obvious to you or the thing that's
[51:53] highest priority or a mixture of both
[51:55] depending on how you're feeling that
[51:56] day. whatever whatever you want needs to
[51:58] be coded in it. So when you're writing a
[52:00] Ralph loop, um I'll show you a link to
[52:03] grab this one at the end, but there's no
[52:04] need to use just mine or or something
[52:07] else. Just start with mine and then say
[52:09] fix this for my project and and and
[52:11] allow it to change and morph and evolve.
[52:14] Couple of questions. So um just come
[52:16] forward. Thank you.
[52:19] >> Hi. Um thanks for the talk. Um could you
[52:22] expand a bit more on the topic of
[52:24] sandboxing because that would be the
[52:26] thing uh stopping me from running this.
[52:28] Uh
[52:29] >> yeah, it makes sense. Yeah. Yeah,
[52:30] absolutely. So there's a number of
[52:32] different ways to sandbox this. For this
[52:33] particular small project, I'm not doing
[52:35] that. Um most of my work happens on a
[52:37] VPS which is away from my main machine.
[52:40] It has a few keys on it that are
[52:42] specific to what I want it to do. And um
[52:45] it can access developer tools. Uh a lot
[52:48] of them it can only access them
[52:49] readonly. Um, it can also access my
[52:51] email, but again, it has quite strict
[52:53] fine grain claw permissions for not
[52:55] sending emails because that's quite
[52:56] important. It I don't let it ever send
[52:58] an email. I only ever let it draft them.
[53:00] So, um, so I use a combination of uh
[53:04] positioning the code physically, not
[53:05] physically, but like away from the
[53:07] machine on a different machine on a VPS.
[53:10] Uh, I use clawed permissions for that as
[53:12] well. The permission system is a bit
[53:13] broken, but it it mostly works. Um, I'm
[53:16] trying you to build lockbox to make it
[53:18] even better. Um I use um what else do I
[53:22] do? Uh so the keys that I use are
[53:24] separate keys. So um the AI has it
[53:27] access to its own keys which I don't use
[53:28] for my other stuff. So I can I can see
[53:31] the kind of audit trail of what it's
[53:32] done. So there's a number of different
[53:34] ways of doing it. Um if you want to just
[53:36] run things simply on your own machine,
[53:38] there's Docker sandbox which is quite
[53:39] cool. It's a new feature in Docker which
[53:41] just allows you to do Docker sandbox cla
[53:43] and a run claw within that sandbox. Um,
[53:45] so you can kind of isolate it within a
[53:48] specific container. That's quite
[53:50] powerful because it allows you to only
[53:52] change things within that specific place
[53:53] in the file system. The challenge with
[53:56] that is that it can still leak data from
[53:58] one of your systems to another of your
[54:00] systems. Uh there's a thing called the
[54:02] lethal trifecta. I don't know if you've
[54:04] heard of that. Simon Wilson uh coined
[54:06] it. um an idea that if you have
[54:09] untrusted tokens, uh internet access and
[54:13] access to secret important data you
[54:16] don't want to lose, you're going to lose
[54:17] that data. Basically, that's that's the
[54:19] the um the bottom line of it. Uh so you
[54:22] have to kind of minimize the amount of
[54:24] times that those things collide in the
[54:25] same context. Um so yeah, lots to say
[54:28] about security and sandboxing
[54:29] specifically. Um, I tend to run I don't
[54:32] run with dangerously skip permissions.
[54:34] Uh, but I do run with with um a number
[54:37] of things turned on by default, but not
[54:39] everything basically. And you kind of
[54:40] have to go through and figure out what
[54:42] what your risk profile is and how much
[54:44] you care about those things. And
[54:45] certainly as you're giving, the main the
[54:47] main things to to read up if you're
[54:49] interested is to read up about the
[54:51] lethal trifecta if you didn't already
[54:52] weren't already aware of it. And um kind
[54:55] of be thoughtful about how much power
[54:58] and permission you're giving to your
[55:00] agents, especially if you're using
[55:01] something like OpenClaw, which is
[55:03] unfortunately insecure by default. Um I
[55:06] know that they've been doing a huge
[55:07] amount of work um on OpenClaw to make it
[55:09] more secure, but it is still a challenge
[55:11] for those kinds of agents. They do have
[55:13] access to a lot of things. Any
[55:16] other questions? Yeah.
[55:19] >> Uh yeah, you had a validation step in
[55:22] the loop.
[55:24] >> Uh this might be anecdotal evidence, but
[55:26] as soon as I changed mine to use sub
[55:29] agents here now for the validation step,
[55:31] it started finding things.
[55:33] >> Ah, interesting.
[55:34] >> Whereas as long as you're doing the
[55:36] validation in the same step with the
[55:38] same context, it just pats itself on the
[55:40] back and like Yeah, it
[55:41] >> that's a really that's a really good
[55:42] point. Um there's definitely uh
[55:45] confirmation bias going on with agents
[55:46] where they're like, "Oh yeah, of course
[55:47] I wrote it fine. It was fine. I checked
[55:48] it a minute ago." Uh yeah, using sub
[55:50] agents is really powerful because a sub
[55:52] agent starts with only a small chunk of
[55:54] context. It doesn't start with the full
[55:56] context, right? So so you can get much
[55:58] more uh power from it. So as a good
[56:01] example from this particular project, um
[56:04] a really useful um skill which I
[56:06] mentioned earlier is simplify.
[56:07] Simplifies a claw coding bundled skill
[56:10] and what it does is it will look at the
[56:12] most recent changes and it will run
[56:14] three sub aents to try and figure out
[56:16] what whether your code should improve.
[56:18] So you you can see here what it's doing.
[56:20] So hopefully this will run these will
[56:22] load and it will probably find a bunch
[56:24] of problems.
[56:25] Yeah, great point.
[56:29] >> Great presentation. Thank you. Uh did
[56:31] you try open spec or combined with
[56:34] openspec or any other spec driven? No,
[56:36] I'm I if I'm honest, I'm not a huge fan
[56:38] of spec driven development. I know
[56:39] that's that's um controversial and I'll
[56:42] qualify that. I'm I worry that spec
[56:45] driven development is taking us at the
[56:48] extreme is taking us back to the bad old
[56:50] days of waterfall where we would specify
[56:53] the entire or try and overspecify a
[56:55] project. Even these little set of
[56:57] tickets I'm not that comfortable with. I
[56:59] feel like spec should be much more
[57:01] iterative um and things that we can see
[57:05] it's already fixing a bunch of things
[57:07] that's quite cool. So it found just to
[57:08] finish off that point it found a bunch
[57:10] of issues there um and it's got some
[57:12] fixes. Uh yes so specs um I like just in
[57:17] time specs. I like the idea of building
[57:19] or thinking through what you're trying
[57:20] to build creating some kind of plan and
[57:22] claw code and then executing it. That's
[57:24] fine. I'm happy about that and I think
[57:26] that's a useful step. What I worry about
[57:28] is a I I worry about things like Kira
[57:30] where they've codified that into the to
[57:33] the tool. I worry that that will almost
[57:36] fossilize that that one approach with
[57:38] with AI that works today but may not
[57:41] work again when mythos eventually comes
[57:42] out. Right? So I worry that the tools
[57:45] are being too quick to jump to a
[57:48] specific structure of work that may not
[57:50] be the right thing in the future. So I'm
[57:52] I'm cautious about that. Um, I think it
[57:55] is obvious. It's a it's a truism that AI
[57:57] needs more context in order to do well.
[57:59] So, we should try and give it more
[58:00] context. But I think the idea of
[58:03] overdoing that and and oversp specking a
[58:05] project is one to be careful of as well
[58:07] as overstructuring our process based on
[58:10] what we know about agents today because
[58:11] then we'll end up with working on with a
[58:14] a new kind of AIdriven process that
[58:16] worked best with agents that came out in
[58:18] 2025 or 2026. You know, when we'll still
[58:21] be using that in 2030 and that'll be a
[58:22] pointless waste of time. So those are
[58:24] the kind of concerns I have with it.
[58:27] Any other questions?
[58:32] >> Yeah, great talk. So uh you mentioned
[58:34] that you don't like spec driven and you
[58:36] use Ralph. So basically there is no
[58:38] human in the loop. So the question
[58:40] arises does clo actually need you there.
[58:44] Where where is your input there?
[58:46] >> Great question. Um so I've been thinking
[58:48] about this quite a lot recently and
[58:49] having a bit of an existential crisis. I
[58:51] don't know about anyone else. Um but um
[58:53] but yes, what what value am I adding
[58:55] here to this thing? Um certainly not
[58:57] with writing a Pomodoro timer. I'm not
[58:58] sure I'm adding much value at all. I
[59:00] mean, I literally said I oneshotted
[59:02] those specs and and there was no point
[59:03] there at all. I'm not saying that I
[59:06] don't I don't like planning out a
[59:08] system. What I'm what I'm interested in
[59:10] at this point and I don't have the
[59:12] answers is the fact that AI often will
[59:15] pick better specs and and write better
[59:18] specs than I can write and will often
[59:20] have a better idea of the kinds of
[59:21] direction my software should go in than
[59:23] I necessarily will have. So I like the
[59:26] idea of actually having Ralph loops that
[59:28] create other Ralph loops um potentially
[59:31] or having Ralph loops that track whole
[59:34] um uh customer engagements or even whole
[59:37] startups. So, I have a a skill that I'm
[59:40] working on. Should I show this? I'm
[59:42] going to show it. It'll be fine. What
[59:44] could go wrong? Um, which is called
[59:47] startup.
[59:49] It's pretty ambitious, but the idea is
[59:52] that it should um basically guide a
[59:55] product through an entire startup
[59:57] framework. Um, so it is it is meant to
[1:00:00] be run as a loop. The idea is that it
[1:00:02] Oh, I see you all taking pictures now.
[1:00:03] Now I'm owning this thing.
[1:00:06] >> Damn it. Um but with great thanks to Ash
[1:00:09] Maru who writes some brilliant stuff on
[1:00:10] this. I should say that for the for the
[1:00:12] for the tape. Um so really really
[1:00:15] helpful um to me. So I built this out of
[1:00:17] um basically all of the cool books I
[1:00:19] I've read about stuff. So I I'm I'm a
[1:00:21] startup founder, co-founder CTO. So so
[1:00:23] this is a near and dear to my heart. And
[1:00:25] what I'm trying to do here is I'm trying
[1:00:27] to give the AI enough context such that
[1:00:30] it could run my startup for me and
[1:00:33] potentially figure out what the next
[1:00:34] most important thing to work is and then
[1:00:36] do that in a loop, you know, and then it
[1:00:38] then there's a big outer loop that runs
[1:00:39] that says, "Okay, well, what's the next
[1:00:41] most important thing to do? Let's do
[1:00:42] that." Um, so it doesn't work, but it
[1:00:45] it's it's interesting and it's getting
[1:00:47] somewhere and um it will often um the
[1:00:50] first thing it does I don't think I've
[1:00:51] got it to show. Um but um Oh yeah, I
[1:00:53] will show it because it is hilarious.
[1:00:55] Hang on just a second. Um, there's a it
[1:00:58] I asked it how it was doing uh on one of
[1:01:01] its loops and it produced a a startup
[1:01:04] update deck as an investor memo which
[1:01:07] was I didn't even ask it to do this.
[1:01:09] I'll show you the the demo. Hang on a
[1:01:11] second. Um because it's absolutely
[1:01:13] brilliant.
[1:01:15] Uh let's see if I can just show this
[1:01:17] window.
[1:01:20] There we go. Air skills startup update.
[1:01:23] Um, and so yeah, it said, "Yeah, I need
[1:01:25] to give him an update." So what I did is
[1:01:27] it said basically this is how far we've
[1:01:28] got. These are the problems nobody has
[1:01:30] solved. This is what we know that's
[1:01:31] real. These are the number of this is a
[1:01:33] skills management tool that I'm working
[1:01:35] on in the background. Um, this is these
[1:01:37] are all the kind of issues. And it came
[1:01:39] up with all of this cool stuff that
[1:01:40] could go into an investor deck. Um, to
[1:01:42] be honest, that's not bad. It's it's not
[1:01:45] a bad I think it's actually the GitHub
[1:01:46] for AI skills, but there we go. And um,
[1:01:48] you know, who's going to pay for this
[1:01:49] thing? How much will they pay? Those
[1:01:50] numbers are definitely not right. But um
[1:01:52] but what's interesting is that it
[1:01:53] decided that it wanted to do this uh and
[1:01:57] figure out all of these numbers based on
[1:01:58] based on this um which is I think was
[1:02:00] hilarious and it was quite proud of this
[1:02:02] deck to be honest and I had to kind of
[1:02:03] be like hang on a minute we haven't you
[1:02:05] there's some serious thinking you need
[1:02:07] to do before you kind of go to that um
[1:02:09] will will or pay for skills government
[1:02:11] would your all pay for skills governance
[1:02:13] great question um not sure yet so anyway
[1:02:16] um the reason for showing that is more
[1:02:17] to kind of point out that that AI can do
[1:02:21] a heck of a lot and and it doesn't do
[1:02:24] startups well yet, but that's probably
[1:02:26] down to my skill file, not down to the
[1:02:30] um agent itself. I I have a feeling that
[1:02:33] there are an awful lot of things that
[1:02:35] potentially will be um will be loops in
[1:02:38] the future. Um I only got that far on my
[1:02:40] slides. Oh my gosh. Um hang on a second.
[1:02:43] Um so we've done that. We've done that.
[1:02:46] If you are still if you're not just
[1:02:47] listening to me and are still working on
[1:02:48] this demo, I've got a couple of
[1:02:49] challenges for you if you'd like to do
[1:02:51] this. One is is um you could try
[1:02:53] upgrading your ticket format. Um if you
[1:02:56] like the raw markdown file, the doc
[1:02:58] tickets is fine. If you wanted to just
[1:03:00] type bd install or or install beads,
[1:03:02] it's super easy to do that. And you
[1:03:04] wanted to kind of get Ralph loop to work
[1:03:05] with your beads, try that out. See if
[1:03:06] that works. You know, no there's no
[1:03:07] pressure on you to achieve anything in
[1:03:09] this little folder. Uh beads is great
[1:03:11] because it only works within your
[1:03:12] folder. So um and it just installs a
[1:03:14] little tool. So it's quite a useful
[1:03:16] thing to to to try it on. So if you
[1:03:18] wanted to try a different ticket format
[1:03:19] or you wanted to kind of move this into
[1:03:22] your main project and connect your your
[1:03:24] Ralph loop to your um ticketing system
[1:03:26] to see how that feels. Yeah, maybe not
[1:03:29] submit tickets yet, but you know, you
[1:03:30] potentially could you could try that and
[1:03:32] see where that takes you. Um so that's
[1:03:34] an option. The other is is the skill. Uh
[1:03:37] you you're going to need to keep
[1:03:38] upgrading and working on your loop. Uh
[1:03:40] the loop basically contains all of the
[1:03:42] knowhow about how you as a person will
[1:03:45] go through that. You can take it all the
[1:03:47] way through from do the next ticket and
[1:03:48] you can take it all the way up to do the
[1:03:50] next step in the world dominating
[1:03:52] startup you're trying to build or
[1:03:54] whatever it is. Um you know it works for
[1:03:56] all of those kind of things. What's
[1:03:58] super interesting about this is that I'm
[1:04:01] I'm more and more convinced that
[1:04:03] everything in fact is a loop. Maybe
[1:04:06] maybe as an engineer I'm definitely on a
[1:04:08] loop on and a lot of the work that I do.
[1:04:10] Uh maybe as a project manager or or
[1:04:12] project manager I'm on a loop. Maybe as
[1:04:14] a CEO I'm on a loop. Who knows? Um maybe
[1:04:19] uh certainly uh a lot of the kind of
[1:04:21] cadences that I work on um run in loops
[1:04:24] too. So um I have a skill and if you're
[1:04:27] running an open claw bot, you're doing a
[1:04:28] similar thing uh that that just runs a
[1:04:31] heartbeat every 15 minutes. Um, it just,
[1:04:34] um, on my, uh, VPS, it just fires up
[1:04:36] Claude, checks a few things, checks my
[1:04:38] calendar, see if I've got anything
[1:04:39] happening, and, um, sends me telegram
[1:04:41] messages. Um, maybe that's on a loop,
[1:04:43] and that is, it's definitely on a loop.
[1:04:44] It's 15 minutes. Um, I have a worker
[1:04:46] loop, which I'll show you in a minute.
[1:04:48] And I have a morning loop where every
[1:04:49] morning at at 6:00 a.m. it comes up with
[1:04:51] a full briefing of my day, figures out
[1:04:54] exactly what I should be doing, um, and,
[1:04:57] uh, just gives me all the information
[1:04:58] that I need that's happened overnight,
[1:04:59] all the emails that come in, all of that
[1:05:01] stuff. Um the the worker loop is
[1:05:04] particularly interesting because it
[1:05:06] basically I'm not sure I can actually
[1:05:09] show this. Uh let's see if I can find
[1:05:12] find something that I can show.
[1:05:15] Um
[1:05:18] let's see.
[1:05:22] No, the reason I can't is because it's
[1:05:23] got a bunch of client information in it.
[1:05:25] So I can't show you that. But um what I
[1:05:27] can show you is for example this screen
[1:05:30] I can show you. So if I quickly switch
[1:05:33] to this
[1:05:35] um
[1:05:41] so this is an app I'll make that
[1:05:42] slightly bigger. This is now how I run
[1:05:45] my worker loop. So this is an app that I
[1:05:48] wrote um uh to manage projects. So I
[1:05:52] don't have tickets inside my my work
[1:05:54] vault. I have project files and each of
[1:05:56] the projects is a is a set of work that
[1:05:58] I need to do. And then every so often I
[1:06:00] have a I basically vibe coded a cambban
[1:06:02] system and a worker will pick up and do
[1:06:04] the next step on the project. So if the
[1:06:06] next step on the project is writing an
[1:06:07] email because it has a an overview or
[1:06:09] it's checking things or uh it's
[1:06:12] producing the slides for my project, it
[1:06:13] will do the next step. So this for
[1:06:15] example is the uh workshop uh prep spec
[1:06:19] uh uh project that it's working on. And
[1:06:21] it's it's got a bunch of front matter
[1:06:23] that is just looking like that. Um and
[1:06:26] um it's got some questions for me. I
[1:06:27] haven't updated this. it needs to be
[1:06:28] updated. It's got the context. It's got
[1:06:30] a decision trail of things that it's
[1:06:31] done and why it's done them. Um and so
[1:06:35] basically for every different thing
[1:06:36] that's happening um it it just is
[1:06:39] figuring out the next one. Um it's also
[1:06:42] got um notes on um other talks that I
[1:06:46] might be giving um that didn't happen in
[1:06:48] the end. Um it's got feedback from a
[1:06:50] previous workshop I did on a similar
[1:06:51] topic um which you can click on.
[1:06:53] Actually, I can't click on that. There's
[1:06:54] a bug. But um it will basically show the
[1:06:56] notes from a feedback session. So so
[1:06:58] this project pulls everything together
[1:07:00] from all of the context you can find and
[1:07:02] then does the next step in a loop. So
[1:07:04] you can run everything in a loop. Uh you
[1:07:06] can run all of your work in a loop. When
[1:07:08] I wake up in the morning, normally I
[1:07:10] have about 15 or 16 draft emails where
[1:07:12] people have got back to me and it's had
[1:07:13] a go at replying them replying to them.
[1:07:15] I always have to edit them. They're
[1:07:17] always okay. But um but it definitely
[1:07:19] has a go at at getting getting on with
[1:07:22] trying to schedule some of my work. I
[1:07:24] have very specific rules about what it
[1:07:26] can and can't do. My basic rule is is
[1:07:28] this reversible without embarrassment to
[1:07:30] me. And um if the answer is no, don't do
[1:07:34] it. Um and but just make a little note
[1:07:36] in the project and hand it back to me.
[1:07:37] Um so sending emails is not allowed to
[1:07:39] do. Creating a slide deck like for
[1:07:41] example this one that's reversible. It
[1:07:43] doesn't cause me any embarrassment. So
[1:07:44] it just gone on and did it um and gave
[1:07:46] it to me. Uh for example, uh it doesn't
[1:07:49] post on LinkedIn for me. It doesn't um
[1:07:51] it doesn't send emails. It doesn't send
[1:07:53] messages. It uh but it does it does get
[1:07:56] everything ready for me to review. To
[1:07:58] your point earlier, which is a very long
[1:07:59] answer to your question, um it um it has
[1:08:03] caused me to genuinely question what I'm
[1:08:06] good at and what I'm here for. Quite a
[1:08:07] lot of the time I've got to a point
[1:08:10] where I'm just the email person who just
[1:08:13] checks emails and send check emails,
[1:08:14] send check. That doesn't sound like a a
[1:08:16] proper job. That doesn't feel good. So,
[1:08:18] so therefore, what does that mean for my
[1:08:20] work? And I've had to make a conscious
[1:08:22] decision. Which bits of my work do I
[1:08:25] want to do and which bits of my work
[1:08:26] don't I want to do. I don't want to be
[1:08:28] the email reviewer, but I do want to be
[1:08:30] the strategist. I do want to be helping
[1:08:32] organizations think through what on
[1:08:34] earth is going on with AI and how to
[1:08:36] kind of fix it for their organization.
[1:08:37] Now, I could get AI to do a bad first
[1:08:39] draft, but I don't want to be reviewing
[1:08:41] AI's draft. I actually want to be doing
[1:08:42] that thinking myself. So therefore, I
[1:08:45] basically said, don't do any of that
[1:08:46] work. I want to do that work. just give
[1:08:48] me all the information I need and I'll
[1:08:49] do the work because I enjoy that work
[1:08:50] and I'm good at it. So, um, AI can do
[1:08:54] all of the rubbish work, but it can't
[1:08:56] and it shouldn't do the work that I'm
[1:08:58] uniquely good at. But because everything
[1:09:00] is a loop and Ralph, this is getting so
[1:09:01] existential because Ralph loops are are
[1:09:03] so um really everything and can be used
[1:09:07] for everything. We have to start asking
[1:09:08] hard questions about which of our bits
[1:09:10] of work we actually want to do. What do
[1:09:12] we want to do um out of this work? It's
[1:09:15] not just about what AI can do or can't
[1:09:17] do anymore.
[1:09:19] Um, yes, there's a question. There's
[1:09:21] like loads of questions, but let's go at
[1:09:22] the back. I think your hand was up
[1:09:24] first. I think the um chat's coming with
[1:09:25] the mic.
[1:09:28] >> Well, we just for the recording, it's
[1:09:30] really helpful. Thank you. So, with the
[1:09:33] open-ended tasks, yeah, how do you think
[1:09:36] about sort of when to stop? So, do you
[1:09:39] set KPIs up at the beginning or how do
[1:09:43] how do you how do you know when it's
[1:09:44] done?
[1:09:45] >> Yeah, great question. Um, I ask it to so
[1:09:48] again this is this comes down to if I
[1:09:50] just go back to sorry different window
[1:09:57] uh this one it comes down to upgrading
[1:09:58] your loop and you have to basically tell
[1:10:00] it when to stop. So, uh I don't just
[1:10:02] have one Ralph loop file that works for
[1:10:05] all of those different loops that I
[1:10:06] showed you earlier. Um, I have different
[1:10:08] ones for each. And for example, the
[1:10:10] worker says, "When you get to a point
[1:10:12] where you've either running out of
[1:10:14] context or you've got to a point where
[1:10:15] there's an irreversible thing to do,
[1:10:17] then I want you to stop and and report."
[1:10:20] And what report means is in this case
[1:10:22] update the project file, which is just a
[1:10:24] file in a repository with what where
[1:10:26] you've got to and in a way that where
[1:10:29] you present it to me for review. So, I'm
[1:10:31] working quite hard at the moment about
[1:10:32] about that kind of presentation step
[1:10:34] because I I definitely don't want to be
[1:10:35] reviewing a diff and just reading text I
[1:10:38] find really difficult um just because
[1:10:40] there's often a huge wall of it and it's
[1:10:42] hard to pause. So, I'm getting it to
[1:10:44] start giving me things step by step in
[1:10:45] slide format. I'm trying to get it to
[1:10:48] that interface I showed you before. You
[1:10:50] can kind of see a little bit how I'm
[1:10:51] trying to get it to show things in
[1:10:52] different places in different ways uh to
[1:10:55] to for it to um uh to get to uh what I
[1:11:00] need to uniquely do next. I suppose so
[1:11:02] it so to the answer your question it
[1:11:04] depends on what you're doing. I think
[1:11:06] the most important bit is that you
[1:11:08] figure out what the edges are for
[1:11:10] yourself and and and have that real you
[1:11:13] know moment of you know what do I
[1:11:14] actually want to be doing? How do I want
[1:11:16] to be involved in this work here? not
[1:11:18] just uh you know AI is helping me do my
[1:11:21] work and a companion to me it's much
[1:11:23] more now which bits do I not even need
[1:11:25] to know about you know uh next question
[1:11:29] there's one here there's a mic just at
[1:11:31] the front somewhere I think yeah great
[1:11:32] thank you
[1:11:36] >> uh hi so since you brought up this topic
[1:11:38] of our involvement right so at what
[1:11:40] stage
[1:11:42] we really get involved I mean you
[1:11:43] mentioned you don't really review the
[1:11:45] diff um I guess the most important part
[1:11:48] of our work now is creating the tickets,
[1:11:50] right? I mean, first identifying what
[1:11:51] the most useful feature to implement is
[1:11:53] and then
[1:11:55] >> describing in a way that you foresee all
[1:11:57] the different edge cases or um just
[1:11:59] explain it the best way possible so that
[1:12:01] the outcome is what you desired in the
[1:12:03] first place.
[1:12:04] >> Yeah.
[1:12:05] >> What's your process of creating this
[1:12:06] tickets? Yeah, great question. And uh
[1:12:08] >> so like like my concern is sometimes you
[1:12:10] don't really know yourself until you
[1:12:13] start implementing. I mean the way we
[1:12:14] used to do it, right? So during the
[1:12:16] development process you encounter
[1:12:18] certain um different cases where you
[1:12:21] need like a custom logic you need to
[1:12:23] it's just difficult to foresee these
[1:12:24] things from the get go and do you like
[1:12:27] iteratively improve the tickets and you
[1:12:29] reimplement them or what's your process?
[1:12:31] >> Yeah great question. So um in terms of
[1:12:34] how I work there are two modes of work
[1:12:36] that is done on my behalf. One is the
[1:12:38] fully automatic work that we're talking
[1:12:40] about here where the I would just get
[1:12:41] something done. I don't need when I've
[1:12:43] got a decent spec that I trust and and
[1:12:45] there's a way of feeding back so that
[1:12:47] the AI knows that it's good. I don't
[1:12:48] need to be involved in that work. That
[1:12:50] can just happen. For every other piece
[1:12:51] of work I do, I have a uh I I work on it
[1:12:56] with and in Claude code. So um I uh with
[1:13:00] that um system I showed you earlier, um
[1:13:03] in fact, I'll go back to it so I can
[1:13:04] show you. Um
[1:13:08] let me just change back to this window.
[1:13:16] Where is it? There it is.
[1:13:22] With this one, at the very bottom of any
[1:13:24] of these kind of projects that it's
[1:13:25] running for me, there's a little thing
[1:13:26] here, which I this is just a vioded app
[1:13:28] that I've written for me. Nobody else
[1:13:29] has access to this. Um, it has a little
[1:13:31] vCP command which if I take that and I
[1:13:34] type this into a terminal window. Um, so
[1:13:38] if I go back to this one for example, I
[1:13:41] think this is okay.
[1:13:43] Um,
[1:13:46] yeah, I can't I can't easily show that
[1:13:48] just because my internet is not going to
[1:13:49] be able to connect to my VPS. But the
[1:13:51] point is is that I'm able to go back to
[1:13:55] um,
[1:13:57] yeah, I'll go back to that.
[1:14:04] The point is is that I'm able to um type
[1:14:08] that in and just paste that into my VPS.
[1:14:10] What that does is it starts a new clawed
[1:14:11] code session. That session grabs knows
[1:14:14] where to find that project and it pulls
[1:14:16] in all of the project context. So rather
[1:14:17] like loading a skill, it loads it as it
[1:14:19] loads the project. It reads the entire
[1:14:20] project file and knows where everything
[1:14:21] else is. At that point, it's loaded in
[1:14:24] everything it needs in order to
[1:14:25] supercharge that session with me and
[1:14:27] then we work together on it. So if I'm
[1:14:29] for example to your point about specking
[1:14:31] tickets, I'd have a ticket I don't know
[1:14:33] probably a project for that particular
[1:14:35] feature and then I would say okay load
[1:14:37] in everything you know about that and it
[1:14:38] would load them all in and then we would
[1:14:39] work back and forth on specking out
[1:14:41] those tickets and then the output would
[1:14:42] be um whatever I needed to get done in
[1:14:44] order to get that done. So if I'm
[1:14:46] working on something that where I I want
[1:14:48] to usefully and uniquely do that myself
[1:14:51] that's when I would jump into a project
[1:14:53] with claw code. And when I say do it
[1:14:54] myself, I don't mean typing it myself or
[1:14:57] I don't mean doing all the thinking. I
[1:14:58] normally mean I get Claude to interview
[1:15:00] me to ask questions so that I can uh
[1:15:04] give it the information it needs to
[1:15:05] formulate to do the writing because I
[1:15:07] don't like doing the typing, but I get
[1:15:09] it to pull the information out of me in
[1:15:11] order to to get that work done. So those
[1:15:12] are the two modes. It's the the back and
[1:15:14] forth iterating and then it's the it
[1:15:17] just the automatic stuff. And I should
[1:15:19] also point out that I don't I don't like
[1:15:21] reading diffs, but ultimately that's the
[1:15:23] only way that you can review code. Um
[1:15:25] when I'm when I'm reading a newsletter
[1:15:28] item, I don't want to read the diff. I
[1:15:29] want to read the newsletter. Whereas if
[1:15:31] I'm reviewing code that's important um
[1:15:33] that is for other people, then yes, I
[1:15:35] read the diffs. I don't like doing it.
[1:15:36] Nobody likes reading diffs, but I I
[1:15:38] check to make sure it's working. And I
[1:15:40] will I can't see myself not doing that
[1:15:42] for a while, especially not with
[1:15:44] security um like conscious code. Maybe
[1:15:47] with mythos or just delegate it. That'd
[1:15:49] be nice. Any other questions?
[1:15:52] Yes, one here.
[1:15:54] >> Um, how do you deal with context rot?
[1:15:56] So, for example, uh your example where
[1:15:59] you have a loop and it takes one task
[1:16:01] after the other. Is it the same cloud
[1:16:03] code session that takes all those tasks?
[1:16:06] >> We'll have to experiment with that with
[1:16:07] the with the slash loop command. Yes, it
[1:16:09] is. Um, it's the same session. Um, I
[1:16:11] when you run it as a kind of while loop
[1:16:13] outside claw, then it's a different
[1:16:14] session. um you have different
[1:16:16] trade-offs uh with that. With the same
[1:16:19] session, you have all the context of the
[1:16:20] previous tickets and the previous
[1:16:21] changes. That might be useful. In
[1:16:24] practice, I've not found that so useful
[1:16:25] because it can just pull the files as it
[1:16:27] goes. Um if you're not typing anything
[1:16:29] into to the session, you're not really
[1:16:32] adding anything to that. So, there's
[1:16:33] nothing really in there that's useful.
[1:16:35] So, I tended I've tended in the past to
[1:16:37] prefer starting a fresh context for each
[1:16:39] new session. Um, but the loop is very
[1:16:41] the slash loop is very easy to run and
[1:16:43] it just works and especially opus is
[1:16:47] very very good at long context
[1:16:48] retrieval. So it's less much much less
[1:16:50] of an issue.
[1:16:52] >> Okay.
[1:16:55] >> Uh, sorry. Yeah, there's a there's one
[1:16:57] at the back as well. Is there a
[1:16:58] microphone as well? Okay, great.
[1:17:01] >> Um, are you reviewing sessions that are
[1:17:03] done by by your loops or or are you just
[1:17:06] reviewing diffs on on the GitHub? Great
[1:17:09] question.
[1:17:10] >> I don't allow any of my workers to close
[1:17:13] a project. Um, so uh I I would always
[1:17:17] say if you think you're done, tell me
[1:17:20] what's finished and I will close I will
[1:17:21] I will close that off. Um, so it could
[1:17:25] it could be that there's a a big list of
[1:17:27] completed things that I need to check
[1:17:28] off check off for myself, but I I want
[1:17:30] to be that kind of final step of
[1:17:32] verification. The reason that I've added
[1:17:34] that is because I worry that I'll miss
[1:17:36] something. There's a thing uh that
[1:17:38] someone coined recently called cognitive
[1:17:40] debt uh which is the idea of just not
[1:17:42] being up to speed with everything that
[1:17:44] your codebase can do or or all of the
[1:17:46] code in your codebase. And that that
[1:17:47] worries me. So so I tend to want to to
[1:17:50] at least understand how the code fits
[1:17:52] together and and how or how the piece of
[1:17:55] work that I'm working on fits together.
[1:17:56] So I don't let AI get away with just
[1:17:59] putting something, you know, out of my
[1:18:01] sight without me having a chance to look
[1:18:02] at it. Otherwise, I feel like I'd lose
[1:18:05] track of what's happening.
[1:18:06] Yeah, because I I mean uh for example, I
[1:18:10] I'm using sessions to to track uh
[1:18:13] tickets.
[1:18:14] >> So, so instead of reviewing the code or
[1:18:17] diffs in the code, I'm just reviewing
[1:18:19] what the particular session was doing
[1:18:21] >> and I even have like a marking system
[1:18:24] which which session is on which status.
[1:18:27] >> Yeah.
[1:18:27] >> Is there any way how how you do it
[1:18:29] similarly?
[1:18:30] >> Um similar. Yeah, I think the sessions
[1:18:32] and the status I I I think that can
[1:18:35] work. Um, I I haven't tended to use
[1:18:38] sessions like that. What I've tended to
[1:18:39] do with sessions is I get Claude to
[1:18:41] every night go through all of the
[1:18:43] previous sessions that I've run that day
[1:18:45] across all the machines I run. Claude,
[1:18:46] it saves them all into a JSON file for
[1:18:48] me. And then I get it to uh both figure
[1:18:51] out how my system could improve uh and
[1:18:53] also just what I did so that I haven't I
[1:18:55] don't forget um what happened. And so it
[1:18:57] writes a little paragraph for how much I
[1:18:59] did. And um and I use that in order to
[1:19:03] uh to kind of track work, but it's not
[1:19:05] quite the same as one ticket per
[1:19:07] session. I quite like the idea of having
[1:19:09] like one context per session. I think
[1:19:11] that's quite a nice idea and one sorry
[1:19:13] one um like by per unit of work. I I
[1:19:17] just haven't made that work. But that's
[1:19:18] >> I I found it really useful because then
[1:19:20] then I can go back to the particular
[1:19:22] session when the particular thinking was
[1:19:24] happening.
[1:19:24] >> Yes. And I do do that for sometimes when
[1:19:27] I've got a project that's running over
[1:19:28] multiple sessions, I can go back to the
[1:19:30] previous session. Um, instead of uh the
[1:19:32] VCP command I showed you, I could type
[1:19:34] VCR and it'll do the same thing. But um
[1:19:36] in practice though I I like the
[1:19:38] discipline of it having to pick up again
[1:19:41] because it mean if it has to pick up
[1:19:43] again from a fresh context it means that
[1:19:45] all of the information that was in that
[1:19:46] session has actually been codified into
[1:19:48] other places that any claude code
[1:19:50] session or human could find which means
[1:19:52] that you end up with a a much more um I
[1:19:57] guess richer kind of repository of
[1:19:59] knowledge that you're working in. So, so
[1:20:01] there's a question mark around if if
[1:20:04] session if you if sessions are truly not
[1:20:06] ephemeral and you've got them as a
[1:20:07] store, are they accessible uh as future
[1:20:10] context? If you treat them as ephemeral
[1:20:12] and make sure you capture everything
[1:20:13] within them into your repository anyway
[1:20:16] or into documentation files or whatever,
[1:20:18] I think that could be more powerful. So,
[1:20:20] worth thinking through for sure.
[1:20:24] Any other questions? Feels like we've
[1:20:26] come a long way from just write this
[1:20:28] ticket, but there we go. It's good. It's
[1:20:29] all good. Yeah,
[1:20:30] >> thank you so much for the talk. I have a
[1:20:32] questions. It seems like uh in the loop
[1:20:34] some of the steps might not be necessary
[1:20:37] like you might go to the code and then
[1:20:38] find nothing there. Y
[1:20:40] >> and would you consider to optimize it
[1:20:43] somehow or you just let the token burn?
[1:20:46] >> No, just burn the tokens. They're not
[1:20:47] that expensive. Depends what you're
[1:20:49] doing. Um I think we're at the point I
[1:20:51] should this is a whole another thing. Um
[1:20:54] we're basically in the era of free
[1:20:56] tokens right now. Um, you know, I I have
[1:20:58] a max 20 subscription. Um, I definitely
[1:21:02] use more than the average person
[1:21:03] probably who is is paying for one of
[1:21:05] those. Um, so I I think at this point I
[1:21:08] would optimize for for freeing your own
[1:21:11] time up as opposed to optimizing for for
[1:21:14] burning a few more tokens. I don't think
[1:21:16] tokens will ever get that expensive. I
[1:21:18] think that the frontier models
[1:21:19] potentially will be very expensive, but
[1:21:21] we have really good uh cheaper or freer
[1:21:24] alternatives just around the corner. Not
[1:21:27] quite as good for the latest kind of
[1:21:29] work that we're trying to do, but
[1:21:30] they're really really good. So, um you
[1:21:32] know, I think um uh there was at least
[1:21:35] one that just came, the GLM one that
[1:21:36] just came out looks really promising. Um
[1:21:39] that's the ZAI one. I think it just came
[1:21:40] out this week. Really, really
[1:21:42] interesting. I'm still running Claude,
[1:21:44] but that won't necessarily always be the
[1:21:45] case. So, I think I I would just burn
[1:21:48] them. I would, like I said at the very
[1:21:50] beginning, um you know, I I spent a long
[1:21:53] time doing the whole optimization thing
[1:21:55] where I was doing this, if you weren't
[1:21:57] here at the beginning, this thing, you
[1:21:59] know, I spent a lot of time trying to to
[1:22:00] screw around with with all of this, but
[1:22:02] but ultimately, I just now let it run.
[1:22:04] It's much simpler. I do get quite close
[1:22:07] to the end of my max subscription
[1:22:08] sometimes, though. I'm slight slightly
[1:22:10] nervous about what that means. I have to
[1:22:11] figure out how to get another account.
[1:22:14] 200.
[1:22:15] >> Yeah, max to the $200 a month one. Yeah.
[1:22:18] Yeah, I get pretty close to that every
[1:22:19] week. I'm quite I'm about 80% now.
[1:22:22] Getting the jitters. Um yeah, you had a
[1:22:24] question. Do you want to bring the mic
[1:22:25] back down? Is that okay? Thank you.
[1:22:35] >> I'm not looking at that anymore.
[1:22:36] >> Hello.
[1:22:38] Is this uh I wanted to ask you about
[1:22:41] Thank you so much for the presentation.
[1:22:42] Yeah, sure.
[1:22:43] >> About fine-tuning for for the prompt,
[1:22:46] >> do you version it? Do you have data sets
[1:22:48] that you use to fine-tune your entire
[1:22:51] loop?
[1:22:52] >> Uh, so in terms of um versioning the
[1:22:54] Ralph loop specifically, like the prompt
[1:22:56] for the Ralph loop.
[1:22:57] >> Yeah.
[1:22:58] >> So I use skills for that. So um as I
[1:23:00] pointed out before um uh everything like
[1:23:04] that goes into the skill and I get
[1:23:06] Claude to write the skill for me. Um,
[1:23:08] and that saves in either your your docu
[1:23:11] skills folder within your project or it
[1:23:13] goes into your home directory under
[1:23:14] doclaude skills. Uh, I use GitHub to
[1:23:16] version all of those for myself. I don't
[1:23:18] think git is the right skills format for
[1:23:21] this long term. I think we need a new
[1:23:23] thing. Hence trying to build skills in
[1:23:25] fact um which is this idea of trying to
[1:23:28] um make skills much more portable and
[1:23:30] sharable within teams which I'm trying
[1:23:31] to figure out. So yes, I do um I do
[1:23:35] version control them and I treat them as
[1:23:37] quite important code and I don't
[1:23:38] actually I do share some of them uh but
[1:23:41] I don't share all of them routinely
[1:23:42] because they there it's a lot of my own
[1:23:44] IP in there and actually a lot of my
[1:23:45] customers IP is in there too.
[1:23:48] >> Yeah, the question was more with regards
[1:23:49] to the performance of the prompts. Mh.
[1:23:51] >> So um you were saying that in the
[1:23:54] beginning you as you go along you
[1:23:56] improve the prompts as you go along and
[1:23:59] but are you versioning the that going
[1:24:01] along and are you versioning the the
[1:24:03] performance of the prompt overall?
[1:24:05] >> So when you say prompt do you mean the
[1:24:08] um the skill itself that I'm using?
[1:24:11] >> Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.
[1:24:12] >> Yes. So yes. So the skill so the prompt
[1:24:15] lives within the skill. So when I type
[1:24:17] slashbug tracking or slashalph uh that
[1:24:21] that is the prompt that that um that
[1:24:23] gets written by claude um and managed by
[1:24:26] claude which means that the um
[1:24:30] uh that whole file is is is the prompt
[1:24:35] and therefore that is version
[1:24:36] controlled. So I I always I have a git
[1:24:39] running within that setup and then every
[1:24:41] time I change it I update um update. But
[1:24:44] you but but you remain subjective how
[1:24:46] you mention you have improved. Let's say
[1:24:48] that you have your data set will be an
[1:24:50] issue. I say that and the expected uh
[1:24:54] output would be the new feature added to
[1:24:57] the repo.
[1:24:57] >> Yeah.
[1:24:58] >> So you could
[1:24:59] >> is it more how do I evaluate whether
[1:25:00] it's any good or how
[1:25:01] >> Yeah, exactly. How do you know you're
[1:25:02] actually improving?
[1:25:03] >> I see. So how do you know if you're
[1:25:04] improving? That's a really good
[1:25:05] question. Um I do um stress test my
[1:25:08] skills. So with other skills uh and I
[1:25:10] say you know is this skill any good?
[1:25:11] Could you improve it? Could you write
[1:25:12] it? Um, I do
[1:25:15] I I spend quite a lot of my time
[1:25:17] tinkering with my system and my skills,
[1:25:18] probably more than I should. Um, I
[1:25:20] think, um,
[1:25:23] it's a bit subjective at the moment.
[1:25:25] What I haven't done, and this would be a
[1:25:26] really good exercise, is to try running,
[1:25:30] um, blind testing where you would run a
[1:25:32] set of tickets with one skill and a set
[1:25:33] tickets with another. Ultimately,
[1:25:36] because Claude is non-deterministic
[1:25:37] anyway, I think there's a high level of
[1:25:39] variability with any of those kinds of
[1:25:41] tests. So, it's it's really difficult to
[1:25:43] think about how to
[1:25:46] to construct a useful test in that way
[1:25:49] to know whether you're actually
[1:25:50] improving or not. Um, in general, the
[1:25:53] more context you give um into your
[1:25:55] prompt, the better it will do up until a
[1:25:58] point which isn't very easy and obvious
[1:26:00] to figure out where it becomes worse.
[1:26:02] So, um it's about kind of balancing that
[1:26:04] ultimately. But yeah, I haven't done a
[1:26:05] kind of objective improvement process. A
[1:26:07] great question though. It's a question
[1:26:08] just behind you.
[1:26:11] How are you version controlling the
[1:26:12] skills?
[1:26:13] >> I'm using GitHub at the moment. Um I do
[1:26:16] have a a product that I'm trying to
[1:26:18] build which is I mean this thing here.
[1:26:20] So if you want my skill by the way
[1:26:21] that's what how you get it. Um it's a
[1:26:23] project called air skills which you saw
[1:26:24] a brief preview of earlier from my my uh
[1:26:27] slide deck that my agent put together
[1:26:29] for me. But the idea is that um you uh
[1:26:33] can package and manage those skills as a
[1:26:35] unit. So you can create skills for your
[1:26:37] organization, you can create skill
[1:26:38] bundles. you can um create a skill set
[1:26:42] for your org that works for different
[1:26:43] teams within your org. Um and then that
[1:26:46] all gets versioned and updated for you
[1:26:47] without everyone having to learn how to
[1:26:48] use git and github. That's the idea. Um
[1:26:50] it is a real pain at the moment. I found
[1:26:52] it really really difficult to manage.
[1:26:54] Just for myself even just putting a
[1:26:55] skill on GitHub. Uh you know I can't
[1:26:58] imagine anyone from there that's quite a
[1:27:00] lot of friction for for a coder like me.
[1:27:02] It's I can't imagine non-coders using
[1:27:04] that. So so yeah trying to trying to
[1:27:05] build this. Um, so yeah, run that
[1:27:07] command on your machine. You'll have my
[1:27:09] skill.
[1:27:12] >> Um, sorry, there's a question just here
[1:27:14] first and then go next. Yeah.
[1:27:15] >> Um, how do you, you sort of touched on
[1:27:17] this a little bit, but sort of around
[1:27:18] the edges. How do you do knowledge
[1:27:20] management? So, I guess, you know, I use
[1:27:24] Claude for
[1:27:26] why is my VPN not working? And then I
[1:27:28] learn something and I want to record
[1:27:29] that and then I'm like I've got some a
[1:27:31] meeting with somebody with a
[1:27:32] transcription and I have that somewhere
[1:27:34] else and I've got a bit of code that I'm
[1:27:36] writing and all all I've got all of
[1:27:38] these different contexts but they're
[1:27:40] sort of very disorganized. Do do you
[1:27:42] have a way of thinking about how you
[1:27:44] organize all of that?
[1:27:45] >> Yeah. So I have a code directory and I
[1:27:48] have a vault directory and those are the
[1:27:49] two directories I work in. So the code
[1:27:52] directory contains a few different
[1:27:54] projects um that I work in a more
[1:27:56] classic way. The vault directory is
[1:27:58] where I do all of my other work and and
[1:28:00] frankly I I mostly start working in
[1:28:03] there even if I'm working on code and
[1:28:04] just tell it where the code is. Uh
[1:28:06] because the vault contains several
[1:28:08] thousand files with all of the different
[1:28:10] stuff that I have picked up learn um
[1:28:14] worked on with Claude over the last
[1:28:16] several years. Well, not with Claude for
[1:28:17] that long, but you know what I mean. Um,
[1:28:19] I started with uh Obsidian a long time
[1:28:21] ago and I've been working on that vault
[1:28:23] for for a long time. Um, and and with
[1:28:27] Claude now it just works on that for me.
[1:28:29] So when I do some research on how to fix
[1:28:31] my VPN or whatever it is, it just saves
[1:28:33] a file in there. I have some specific
[1:28:35] rules for how to kind of structure and
[1:28:37] manage that. Um, if you're interested
[1:28:39] more, I haven't written a lot about
[1:28:40] this, but I know Andre Kapathy's just
[1:28:42] written about it using LM as a wiki.
[1:28:43] That's a great article if you haven't
[1:28:44] seen it already. Um I know there's a
[1:28:47] Minjovich actually funnily enough has
[1:28:49] done a thing on me palace yesterday.
[1:28:51] That's another version of this. Um uh
[1:28:54] you can you can use that too. There's
[1:28:55] lots of different systems for that that
[1:28:57] out there. The best way to get started
[1:28:59] is it's markdown files in a file system
[1:29:02] and use it like a wiki. So run obsidian
[1:29:05] in one window and um claude in the other
[1:29:08] and just kind of work with it and and
[1:29:09] save things as you go. And so do you
[1:29:11] have an agent that then structures and
[1:29:14] puts those fault into folders or
[1:29:15] something like that?
[1:29:15] >> Yes. So it depends on your method. I use
[1:29:17] the zetlecast approach which is the one
[1:29:19] where you have one note per thought. So
[1:29:20] any thought of all just goes into a flat
[1:29:23] folder. Then I have a slash projects uh
[1:29:26] thing which has all of the projects that
[1:29:27] you saw um including one for this
[1:29:29] presentation. Um which which is my kind
[1:29:31] of unit of work for an agent that we
[1:29:33] work on together. It does a lot and then
[1:29:34] I do some and then it does some. Uh I
[1:29:36] have um transcripts in there. all of the
[1:29:38] the calls that I've ever recorded go in
[1:29:40] there. Um, and I use a tool called
[1:29:42] Leanne, uh, which is a command line
[1:29:46] embeddings tool. So, it basically just
[1:29:47] runs embeddings across the entire all of
[1:29:50] the text in the repository, all of the
[1:29:51] transcripts, all of the links I've ever
[1:29:52] saved, including all of the content.
[1:29:54] It's huge. Um, and um, then it can find
[1:29:56] things usefully and easily in there. Um,
[1:29:58] so you you the best time to start that
[1:30:01] is today because it just takes years to
[1:30:03] put together.
[1:30:05] I need to write more about that. Any
[1:30:07] other questions? Yes, one here.
[1:30:09] >> You said you had friction while
[1:30:11] versioning your skills. I've been using
[1:30:13] skills only for last month, so I'm not
[1:30:15] aware of this friction. Can you explain
[1:30:17] what the friction is?
[1:30:18] >> Um, I can I'm sure there are Has anyone
[1:30:20] here had had any kind of friction with
[1:30:22] my kind of managing and using skills
[1:30:23] yet? Has anybody else? Yeah, quite a few
[1:30:25] different people. So, yeah, it's it's a
[1:30:27] it's an emerging thing. It's not
[1:30:28] surprising you haven't experienced it
[1:30:29] yet if you're not using it for very
[1:30:31] long. What I found is that if you're
[1:30:33] just using them on your own, creating a
[1:30:35] file of skills and managing them is is
[1:30:37] quite straightforward. Putting them in
[1:30:39] GitHub is quite straightforward. It's
[1:30:40] sim links and and GitHub repository.
[1:30:42] It's fine. What where it becomes
[1:30:44] difficult is how you share that. So, how
[1:30:45] would you share a skill? Okay. Well, if
[1:30:48] you want to use MPX skills, you have to
[1:30:50] then put it in its own GitHub
[1:30:51] repository. That feels quite heavy
[1:30:53] weight just for one skill. I'd have to
[1:30:54] have 50 of them in order to share all my
[1:30:56] skills. So, that doesn't really work.
[1:30:57] Then it's more like, okay, if I don't
[1:30:59] want to do that, I just do I just send
[1:31:00] them the skill file? Do I send them a
[1:31:02] zip file? I mean, I can't think of a
[1:31:04] better way of doing it. Um, do I have to
[1:31:06] have a subm module in my skills folder
[1:31:07] for every single Git repository I share
[1:31:09] a skill with? It just doesn't make any
[1:31:11] sense. So, I think I think the idea of
[1:31:15] Claude has got some stuff in there
[1:31:16] around plug-in marketplaces where you
[1:31:18] can have a plugin which has a bunch of
[1:31:20] skills. That's the best way, but then
[1:31:21] you're versioning the plug-in, not the
[1:31:22] skills. So, that's probably the most
[1:31:24] seamless way. it just it just doesn't
[1:31:26] work that well. Also, there's a
[1:31:28] challenge around if you if somebody
[1:31:31] contributes to your skill, do you want
[1:31:33] their changes or not? It will depend on
[1:31:34] what the contribution is. Are they local
[1:31:36] to just them or are they um uh changes
[1:31:40] that could be generally incorporated and
[1:31:42] that depends on the skill and depends on
[1:31:43] them. So, you have to then manage that.
[1:31:45] So, do you run a backlog for each skill
[1:31:47] where you have tickets to improve the
[1:31:49] skills? Do you see do you see the kind
[1:31:50] of I think these are all unsolved
[1:31:52] problems. I'm trying to my contribution
[1:31:54] is trying to solve some of those. But
[1:31:55] these these are big problems we haven't
[1:31:57] figured out yet.
[1:31:59] Um other questions?
[1:32:02] There's one right at the back. Um if
[1:32:03] there's a mic that would be amazing.
[1:32:05] Thank you.
[1:32:09] One, two, one. Okay, it's working. Uh my
[1:32:12] question is about how we can uh scale up
[1:32:15] this approach with Ralph loop but like
[1:32:18] for the actual production team like I I
[1:32:20] don't know three engineers how to
[1:32:23] coordinate how to cooperate do you have
[1:32:25] any idea how we can organize it? Do you
[1:32:28] have any experience?
[1:32:29] >> That's a big question. How so just to
[1:32:32] make sure I've understood it. How do you
[1:32:34] scale this up so that you can coordinate
[1:32:36] whole teams using this kind of looping
[1:32:38] approach?
[1:32:39] >> Is that Yeah.
[1:32:41] with all the tickets and the skills.
[1:32:42] Yeah.
[1:32:45] >> 100%. Yeah, it's difficult. I think the
[1:32:47] teams that are where I've seen this work
[1:32:48] well is where they are proactive about
[1:32:51] updating tickets. The great thing is if
[1:32:52] you connect your ticketing system to the
[1:32:54] AI, it's really good at updating it. So,
[1:32:56] you should definitely do that. Um, make
[1:32:58] sure that you claim the ticket and move
[1:32:59] it into the doing column before it
[1:33:01] starts work. Um, and make sure that
[1:33:03] somebody else hasn't just done that
[1:33:04] before you start work. Do you see what
[1:33:05] I'm saying? That's really important to
[1:33:07] avoid contention. Those have always been
[1:33:08] issues with with bigger teams. Um, just
[1:33:12] in the same way, a couple of
[1:33:13] controversial things. Just in the same
[1:33:15] way that Ralph loops work really well by
[1:33:17] just doing one thing in a loop and quite
[1:33:19] sequentially. Um, you know, it could
[1:33:21] well be that the coordination overhead
[1:33:24] in our teams is caused by the fact we've
[1:33:26] got too many people in our teams and
[1:33:27] maybe we should have smaller teams and
[1:33:29] just more of them, right? So maybe maybe
[1:33:31] if you're trying to get 10 people to
[1:33:33] coordinate and using AI and Ralph loops
[1:33:35] and all of that, that's just not going
[1:33:36] to work. maybe you need three and maybe
[1:33:38] that's the way to to kind of run that
[1:33:40] project and then you split it down and
[1:33:41] then you have another the other seven
[1:33:43] people doing something else or or
[1:33:44] whatever. Does that make sense? So, so
[1:33:46] making the problem go away is the first
[1:33:48] step and making sure that you're already
[1:33:50] using your coordination mechanisms is
[1:33:52] the second step. Um and then just try it
[1:33:55] and and figure out what what the
[1:33:58] bottlenecks are. Be really, you know, be
[1:34:01] really good at retrospectives uh with
[1:34:03] this stuff. I think retrospectives and
[1:34:05] teams are often pretty anemic. It's like
[1:34:07] what should we do less of? What should
[1:34:08] we do more of? That's just a recipe for
[1:34:10] the same, more of the same. Um, and just
[1:34:12] changing tiny increments, which can be
[1:34:14] good, but ultimately this requires a
[1:34:17] radical rethink. So, be really conscious
[1:34:21] in making sure that your retrospectives
[1:34:24] are changing actual things about how you
[1:34:26] actually work or or have space to try.
[1:34:29] Let's just try using a RA flip on all of
[1:34:31] our work for a week and see what
[1:34:32] happens, you know? And if it doesn't
[1:34:33] work after two days, that's fine, you
[1:34:35] know. And then if you are someone here
[1:34:37] who's in a leadership capacity and is
[1:34:39] able to sponsor that kind of work, this
[1:34:41] is what it means to try and move to AI.
[1:34:43] If you want to transform your team, you
[1:34:45] are going to have to sponsor these kind
[1:34:46] of experiments and be okay with failure
[1:34:48] because so I was speaking to the leaders
[1:34:49] in here for a minute because it's going
[1:34:50] to be messy and it's going to it's going
[1:34:52] to fail a lot. But if you want real
[1:34:54] transformation, that's the only way to
[1:34:55] get it. You've got to give um your team
[1:34:57] space to try a whole bunch of different
[1:34:58] things. So give them air cover. Um so
[1:35:00] yeah it's it that's a big and
[1:35:02] complicated question. Um I think if
[1:35:06] you're able to and have the agency to
[1:35:07] just try it and see where it gets to.
[1:35:09] There's a whole um uh separate thing
[1:35:13] called uh theory of constraints which I
[1:35:15] haven't talked about at all which is the
[1:35:17] idea that within any team in any system
[1:35:20] there is always a bottleneck. There's
[1:35:21] always one bottleneck that's the big
[1:35:22] bottleneck. If you don't work on that
[1:35:25] one bottleneck, all of the other work
[1:35:27] that you might do to optimize and
[1:35:28] improve the system is pointless and
[1:35:30] actually probably counterproductive. So
[1:35:33] this is why some teams when using AI
[1:35:35] tools and using advanced AI tools like
[1:35:38] Ralph Loops, which is just, you know, AI
[1:35:40] or you know what we're doing now, but
[1:35:42] just on steroids, some teams when they
[1:35:44] implement it actually go slower. Some
[1:35:47] teams go amazingly fast, some teams go
[1:35:49] slow. Why is that? it's because they're
[1:35:52] not working on the constraint. The
[1:35:54] constraint in those teams might be the
[1:35:56] review process. If you or the release
[1:35:58] process, if you release your code once a
[1:36:00] month, um, and you're shipping 200 PRs,
[1:36:04] not 20 in that release, how do you think
[1:36:05] that's going to go, right? You know,
[1:36:07] it's not going to go well. So, that's
[1:36:09] why teams go slower because what they
[1:36:10] need to do is fix their release process,
[1:36:12] not their coding speed. Um, so always
[1:36:14] fix the thing that is the biggest
[1:36:16] bottleneck first. Then figure out where
[1:36:18] the bottleneck moves in the system and
[1:36:19] that's not predictable. It's random. So
[1:36:21] you have to figure that out. Then move
[1:36:22] and fix the next thing in the system.
[1:36:24] For more on that, read the gold by Elio
[1:36:26] Goldrat from 1984, no less. It's an
[1:36:29] amazing It's amazing book. Um, one more.
[1:36:33] Is there another question down here? Is
[1:36:35] there another mic? Where's the mic?
[1:36:36] >> I have a mic.
[1:36:37] >> Oh, you've got a mic. Great. Keep going.
[1:36:40] Um
[1:36:42] since you were asking about like talking
[1:36:43] about the constraints part this reminded
[1:36:45] me like I'm part of the AI team and we
[1:36:48] have an NI team and they write a lot of
[1:36:49] microservices and it's in different
[1:36:52] repositories.
[1:36:53] >> Okay.
[1:36:53] >> How do you deal with uh like coding now
[1:36:57] since is it like one big monor repo or
[1:36:59] is it like small small repos?
[1:37:01] >> Um you you have to try it different ways
[1:37:02] and see. Um, I don't think that the
[1:37:07] the GitHub or sorry, Git architecture,
[1:37:09] whether it's many repos or one repo
[1:37:11] really matters. You can always start
[1:37:13] your AI in um a folder above all of your
[1:37:16] other repos and just get it to work. It
[1:37:18] does a great job of that. So, that's
[1:37:19] okay. I think the bigger question is
[1:37:22] what are the coordination patterns
[1:37:24] within your teams and your services?
[1:37:26] Who's responsible for what? And how does
[1:37:28] that change with with AI? I think that's
[1:37:30] a more interesting challenge. The main
[1:37:33] reason I'm asking this was because like
[1:37:36] some of the microservices depend on
[1:37:38] others
[1:37:38] >> and then you have to release one of them
[1:37:40] you need to release a tag and then
[1:37:42] updating another and that's just
[1:37:44] >> yeah I think what AI will do is it will
[1:37:46] expose all of the places in which that
[1:37:48] process is inefficient because it will
[1:37:50] do everything faster which means that
[1:37:52] you if you're seeing those bottlenecks
[1:37:54] where you are getting dependencies
[1:37:56] between your microservatives guess what
[1:37:57] that's your biggest bottleneck um
[1:37:59] therefore you fix it. So how do you fix
[1:38:01] that bottleneck? Well, you might try
[1:38:03] atomic release system or you might build
[1:38:05] something that using claude that using a
[1:38:07] ra loop that um figures out a way of um
[1:38:11] uh coordinating releases across multiple
[1:38:12] repos more successfully. I don't know.
[1:38:14] But that's what you do. That's where you
[1:38:15] work. Don't work on anything else until
[1:38:17] that's fixed. If that's the bottleneck.
[1:38:20] >> Yeah, there's a question here. Do you
[1:38:21] want to pass the mic?
[1:38:21] >> Yes.
[1:38:23] >> I should say I'm kind of at the end of
[1:38:25] the content. There's if you which
[1:38:27] probably was was clear half an hour ago.
[1:38:29] Um, the only other thing I I mean I had
[1:38:31] a Q&A slide. If you are leaving, you're
[1:38:34] welcome to leave, but you're welcome to
[1:38:34] save for more questions. I would really
[1:38:36] appreciate some feedback though. So,
[1:38:37] this this QR code is the only thing that
[1:38:39] I manually added to these slides. Um, if
[1:38:42] you could just um fill that in, that
[1:38:45] would be lovely and amazing. Thank you.
[1:38:46] It's literally only three minutes, four
[1:38:48] questions. Um, it just helps me to
[1:38:50] improve and make sure that I do a good
[1:38:52] job of these workshops going forward.
[1:38:53] Um, that's also my LinkedIn. I post a
[1:38:56] lot of content on there. Do um do
[1:38:58] connect with me. you do um in case you
[1:39:00] mean some of this stuff, disagree with
[1:39:02] me. I love disagreement. I love it when
[1:39:03] people say, "Surely Chris, that's nuts.
[1:39:05] You shouldn't be doing that." Love those
[1:39:07] kind of comments. Uh because it really
[1:39:09] helps me to think and improve, which is
[1:39:11] what I love to do and because all
[1:39:13] because the Ralph Loops is doing all my
[1:39:14] other work. So, got no got nothing else
[1:39:16] to do.
[1:39:18] Uh great. Thank you. Um so, I just
[1:39:21] wanted to put that up there. Very happy
[1:39:22] to continue answering questions though.
[1:39:23] Um but if people wanted to drift away,
[1:39:25] then that might be a good time. Go for
[1:39:27] it. Um, my question is regarding multi-
[1:39:29] aent orchestration tools. My I'm curious
[1:39:31] if you've tried things like CVG's
[1:39:34] Gasttown or yes,
[1:39:36] >> there's another guy who does like MCP
[1:39:38] agent mail.
[1:39:39] >> Yeah, there's some really cool and
[1:39:40] interesting stuff. I still think we're
[1:39:42] in the wild west literally with Gasttown
[1:39:44] and things like that, but we we don't
[1:39:46] really know how how that's going to go.
[1:39:48] I have tried Gasttown. I couldn't really
[1:39:49] get it to work, but it was pretty early
[1:39:51] on. Uh for me I feel like the the agent
[1:39:55] orchestration side of things is I I
[1:39:58] think that we over complicate things by
[1:40:01] assuming that they need to be in
[1:40:02] parallel. I quite like the idea of just
[1:40:04] starting with a loop to start with. I
[1:40:06] don't feel the need to um have my AI um
[1:40:12] do lots of things at once before I can
[1:40:14] get just get it to to to do one thing.
[1:40:16] Well, it kind of goes back to the theory
[1:40:18] of constraints thing again. Um, I don't
[1:40:21] think speed of, you know, number of
[1:40:23] tokens per second is the bottleneck. I
[1:40:25] think that it's our ability to specify
[1:40:27] what we want and review what the AI has
[1:40:28] done. So, so if that's my bottleneck, I
[1:40:31] don't want to introduce more agents. So,
[1:40:32] I haven't spent lots of time with those
[1:40:34] tools kind of for that reason. I feel
[1:40:36] like they're solving a problem that not
[1:40:38] many people have yet.
[1:40:39] >> Yeah. So, so
[1:40:41] >> hello. Yeah.
[1:40:42] >> Yeah. Not just for speed, but for
[1:40:43] example, I don't know if you've
[1:40:45] experimented with MCP agent mail. So
[1:40:48] agents can uh lock files and speak to
[1:40:50] each other so they don't step on each
[1:40:52] other's toes and you can use different
[1:40:54] like cloud opus and codecs work on the
[1:40:57] same project so you get different brains
[1:40:59] working on the same project.
[1:41:00] >> Nice. Yeah. No, I haven't I think I've
[1:41:02] heard of it but I haven't tried it.
[1:41:03] Sounds like a super interesting idea
[1:41:04] rather like someone mentioned earlier
[1:41:06] about sub aents trying to look at things
[1:41:08] from a different perspective. I've had a
[1:41:10] lot of value for with doing that. I
[1:41:12] mentioned earlier my simulate audience
[1:41:14] um approach which takes um ultimately
[1:41:16] the way the way that it works by the way
[1:41:18] is it takes like um uh transcripts and
[1:41:20] also survey responses on my website and
[1:41:23] it it creates personas and has those
[1:41:26] personas think differently in parallel
[1:41:28] sub aents to take fresh looks at content
[1:41:31] from different perspectives. Um so that
[1:41:33] whole idea of having it um having two
[1:41:36] different things and two different
[1:41:36] models as well in that instance is a
[1:41:38] super interesting one. I think we'll see
[1:41:40] a lot more of that. I can see a lot of
[1:41:41] value in it. We definitely know that a
[1:41:44] they're pretty good at agreeing with
[1:41:45] themselves and you often get better a
[1:41:47] better contrarian take if you throw away
[1:41:48] the context and look at it again. So
[1:41:50] great principle. I think the the tooling
[1:41:53] is still super early which we all know
[1:41:54] but they're interesting ideas for sure.
[1:41:57] >> There's a question just behind you.
[1:42:06] >> Yeah, just keep going. They all turn on.
[1:42:08] >> So great talk by the way. Thank you. Um
[1:42:11] how much importance do you put on? So in
[1:42:13] terms of phases of how you develop
[1:42:15] you're spending a lot of time building
[1:42:17] out the context, creating the tickets
[1:42:19] and you have a system to run them in
[1:42:21] sequence
[1:42:23] gets pushed up. How much do you focus or
[1:42:25] emphasize on CI/CD running automated
[1:42:28] tests linting? Um does that give you the
[1:42:32] confidence to reduce the amount of code
[1:42:35] you're reviewing?
[1:42:36] >> Absolutely. Uh well yes and no. It
[1:42:38] depends what the code is. I think
[1:42:41] firstly I think CI/CD good testing is
[1:42:44] absolutely essential. Linting and all of
[1:42:46] those things. If you want an AI to do a
[1:42:48] good job for you, why wouldn't you give
[1:42:49] it those tools to to help it do a good
[1:42:52] job for you, right? Just the same way
[1:42:53] that humans do much better when they
[1:42:54] have linting and CI/CD and good tests.
[1:42:56] It's exactly the same. It's the same
[1:42:58] with clean code bases. You know, um you
[1:43:00] know, it's worth doing all of that work
[1:43:01] to make an AI do well. So, so that does
[1:43:04] give me more confidence in what I'm
[1:43:05] doing. The challenge is if the AI writes
[1:43:07] the tests then and also writes the code
[1:43:10] then there's a good chance that it's got
[1:43:12] something wrong about what you're trying
[1:43:13] to build. So often it doesn't make it
[1:43:16] doesn't make kind of obvious mistakes.
[1:43:18] The things that it gets wrong is it just
[1:43:19] completely misunderstands a feature,
[1:43:21] builds and says, "Yep, that's fine." And
[1:43:23] then ships it and then I'm like, "Oh my
[1:43:24] goodness, I don't I don't quite let it
[1:43:26] ship all the things." Only only with
[1:43:28] pre-release projects do I do that. But
[1:43:30] um but yes um it does give me confidence
[1:43:33] in in knowing that the thing uh is is I
[1:43:37] guess uh functionally acceptable for
[1:43:40] release or releasable. What I I still
[1:43:42] want to read the diffs because I still
[1:43:44] don't trust an AI with security. Um so
[1:43:48] um I don't know if I've lost uh lost the
[1:43:51] screen. There we go. Thank you. Um I
[1:43:52] think my computer went to sleep. I I I
[1:43:55] just don't quite trust the AI not to
[1:43:57] lose my customers data and I just won't
[1:43:59] compromise on that. So I will read the
[1:44:00] disc because I don't want to be
[1:44:03] responsible for that. Um it doesn't feel
[1:44:08] uh it doesn't feel like it feels like
[1:44:10] there are some problems for which you
[1:44:12] can trust AI fully like for example um
[1:44:15] linting uh testing. There are some
[1:44:17] problems which you can't really trust AI
[1:44:19] just because it's not responsible to do
[1:44:20] so. So maybe specific changes around
[1:44:23] security. If you're running production
[1:44:24] database migrations, you should probably
[1:44:25] check that they worked before running
[1:44:27] them in production. Um, and there are
[1:44:28] some that are a bit more fuzzy and hazy.
[1:44:30] So, uh, UI testing is quite interesting
[1:44:32] early. You know, the idea of having a a
[1:44:34] great feedback mechanism. If you're able
[1:44:36] to get an AI to click through your um
[1:44:39] project to check that it works, that's
[1:44:41] really powerful. It works 50% of the
[1:44:44] time in my experience, but it can be
[1:44:45] quite useful at least to have a first go
[1:44:47] at it. Uh having good endto-end tests is
[1:44:49] actually really helpful if you're using
[1:44:51] playright or something like that which
[1:44:52] it maintains for um for the skills
[1:44:55] project I showed you. Uh I have some
[1:44:57] very comprehensive end toend tests that
[1:44:58] set up full file systems of skills and
[1:45:00] get the AI to create two different um
[1:45:03] personas with running each you know a
[1:45:05] publisher and a creator and it just
[1:45:07] checks all the files are in the right
[1:45:08] places and that's really really useful
[1:45:10] um for those kind of full end to end
[1:45:12] tests. Um equally um uh if you're able
[1:45:16] to to build those kind of feedback
[1:45:18] mechanisms and give the AI a chance to
[1:45:21] um to really know whether it's done well
[1:45:23] that that's a brilliant place to be. And
[1:45:25] so I'm always looking to figure out how
[1:45:28] if an AI could tell whether something
[1:45:30] was good or not rather than me. And when
[1:45:32] I'm able to take myself out of that
[1:45:33] loop, it just massively improves the
[1:45:36] whole process. It's not always possible
[1:45:37] or desirable, but as much as I can, I
[1:45:40] do.
[1:45:41] You are designing the feedback uh
[1:45:44] process though you're you're
[1:45:45] >> you're deciding on the criteria and then
[1:45:47] letting AI execute on top of it.
[1:45:49] >> Yes. Um if if I'm working in a team of
[1:45:51] one, yes. If I am working with a product
[1:45:54] owner or product manager u or a
[1:45:56] designer, I'm really interested in in
[1:45:59] utilizing their skills and testers as
[1:46:01] well to to figure out ways to design
[1:46:04] those pro. This is what they this is the
[1:46:05] value that they bring to these
[1:46:07] processes, right? is how just in the
[1:46:09] same way that coders are thinking how
[1:46:10] could we avoid doing the typing
[1:46:12] ourselves now uh what about um if you're
[1:46:15] a product manager how do you um get the
[1:46:18] AI to do the easy stuff so that you
[1:46:20] don't have to do it you know how do you
[1:46:22] go through that process um same with
[1:46:24] testers uh super interesting area of
[1:46:26] research
[1:46:27] >> two things that come to mind on this
[1:46:29] have you what works well for in a small
[1:46:31] team what works what worked well for me
[1:46:33] is setting up adversarial reviews where
[1:46:36] you have spec
[1:46:37] The dev agent goes develops a reviewer
[1:46:40] that does an adversarial review. You
[1:46:42] pass that context back. The dev agent
[1:46:44] iterates generally catches a lot of
[1:46:46] things increases the amount of
[1:46:48] confidence I have to ship it. But even
[1:46:51] with that, the with the rate at which
[1:46:55] you can create specs and how much code
[1:46:57] you actually have to review, I end up
[1:47:00] being the bottleneck in the review
[1:47:02] process still.
[1:47:03] >> Yeah. Have you I'm always I'm always a
[1:47:06] bottleneck. I have 30 different things
[1:47:08] that I need to now review that my AI has
[1:47:10] done overnight or something and I'm just
[1:47:13] like oh my gosh, you know, and and the
[1:47:15] challenge for me is that a lot of that
[1:47:17] is not work that I should be doing. The
[1:47:19] only reason that it's given it to me is
[1:47:20] because I can't trust the AI with it,
[1:47:22] but any human could do that kind of
[1:47:24] work. So I'm now like, do I hire humans
[1:47:27] to just do the boring work? Is that
[1:47:30] ethical? You know, this is kind of an
[1:47:32] interest really interesting questions um
[1:47:35] for us to think through, but you're
[1:47:36] right. If we're able to design system, I
[1:47:38] love your adversarial point to to builds
[1:47:40] on something else somebody else was
[1:47:41] saying. Um if we're able to do that and
[1:47:43] design these systems such that we don't
[1:47:45] have to be in the loop, I think that is
[1:47:47] better for all of us because I don't
[1:47:49] just want to give a human a terrible
[1:47:51] job.
[1:47:52] >> Till then, we're employed. So,
[1:47:54] >> yeah, I guess.
[1:47:56] >> Thank you.
[1:47:57] >> No worries. Any other questions?
[1:48:03] Should we call it there? Folks, it's
[1:48:05] been a pleasure hanging out with you.
[1:48:07] Um, really, really fun.
